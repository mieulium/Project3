0,"**TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

1,"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

---

Yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. It's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***Comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. If you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

**But if someone's being offensive with their remarks, rEpOrT it. Can't stress this enough.**"

3,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dk9k82/found_out_my_m38_wife_f27_has_been_flirting)

Wanted to firstly say thanks to the few people who were genuinely supportive with their comments/DMs. 

I also have a special place in my heart for the users who called me spineless, a sissy,  a pussy etc. And the few users who told me to ""do the guys wife"" It's exactly what I needed to hear, what else was I expecting from this cesspit ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I sent his wife a message on Facebook Monday explaining what I knew,  with screenshots for evidence. She was devastated. 

This whole mess isn't anywhere near being sorted and I would provide more detail but after the comments on my original post I can't be bothered to deal with this as well as what's left of my family. 

Adios"
4,"(Reposted this after the moderators removed the old post and told me to use a throwaway account).

For context: my son is far from a problem child (in my opinion). He is an 18 year old high school senior who got into a great university to study computer science, he is one of the best swimmers on his team, he’s not getting into too much trouble aside from some drinking here and there, etc. He has a couple guy friends and a few girl friends who hang out and do socially awkward shit together. We have a great relationship with him—he listens to us when we talk about safe sex, avoiding hard drugs, etc. 

So—Yesterday I got a call around 4:30 from my wife, who was telling me I need to get home “RIGHT NOW”*. Apparently she had borrowed his laptop and found something on  it. I was terrified, thinking the worst.

When I got home, she had a Reddit account pulled up on his laptop. His username was signed in, and she had the posts pulled up. One of them was a picture of our son on a “femboy” subreddit wearing tights/skirt/makeup/etc. and my first reaction was *“Okay, Mija, we don’t need to be seeing this unless he is endangering himself. We’re not supposed to see this”*. She was pissed at my reaction and forced me to keep looking. His post was very highly upvoted and although it had no nudity, all the comments were pretty obscene. I said *”okay, we should warn him about putting his face online. Definitely bad”*. 

She said *”that’s all you’re worried about?”* I said *”yes, Mija. He is 18 now. I know this is shocking but this isn’t our business anymore”*. She looked at me like I just shot our cat. She went through his whole profile and pointed out the memes he posted to r/bisexual and jokes he made about “femboys”. Under her breath she kept saying *”fucking sick, this is fucking sick stuff”*.

 I said *”I know this is a lot for us to take in, but we taught him about safe sex and now the ball isn’t in our court. If he isn’t endangering himself, we should just let him be. If there’s anything he needs to tell us, he will do it on his own time”*. 

Again she looked at me with utter contempt and disgust. *”our son is...a fucking pervert, he is getting into sick stuff”*. She was borderline hyperventilating. 

I get why she’d be shocked (as am I), but this is also ironic and hypocritical coming from her. She is the most ultra-progressive, *”we don’t need to be constrained by gender roles”* type of person, regularly attending feminist conferences. Although to be fair, she is what the internet would call a “TERF”—basically she thinks all MTF trans people and gender-noncomforming guys are actually just sick fetishists who are out to rape women (we generally stay out of each other’s politics). I guess she might be associating our son with that stuff. 

Anyway, I was initially sympathetic to her, but I got pretty mad at her when she started talking about our son in a way that a loving mother really shouldn’t. I was scared for our son, when he comes home and hears this kind of talk coming from his mother. I got pretty mad and probably called her a neurotic, prudish bitch somewhere in there and she stormed into our bedroom and locked the door. My son came home and we acted normal, but his mom stayed in the room all night. I told him “she had a headache”. 

Fast forward to this morning—I am at work and have no clue what to do about this. I am an idiot in every single way, so please tell me what I’ve done wrong and what I should do going forward."
5,"I told my boyfriend that I wanted a birthday gift this year (I usually don’t celebrate it) and I had sent him a few things. Makeup stuff, a fuzzy sweater, random things. I told him that I was expecting something nice. Keep in mind, I always treat him to an expensive dinner for his birthday ($100). I was asking him a few weeks before the big day and I was bugging him and asking him what he was getting me. He laughed and said that he was gonna put some candles I bought last year in a gift basket. I paid for those with my own money. That’s a horrible present. I was like “no you’re joking, tell me what you really got me” but he’d just shrug and laugh. So then my birthday was today, I was expecting something big, and he literally gave me my own candles in a basket. I was mad but I didn’t even say anything and just looked at them and ignored them. He was asking me if I liked them and I just said whatever and moved on from it. I was in a bad mood and honestly just felt hurt and ignored. I had been sending him things for weeks. Anyway, he just thought it was funny and that’s it. Horrible birthday. I feel super unloved. 

I’m not sure if I should just forget about it or if I should tell him that I’m upset."
6,"I've been with with her for 9 month now. We always discuss when there is a problem,we do yell but we always calm down to talk normally. Honestly I thought everything was fine,but I think I saw another face of her personality.

To put a bit of context, there was a birthday party Tuesday night of one of our friend, let's call him Robert. At first I was supposed to go with my SO, but I had to put extra hours for the say at work and couldn't come until later.
I arrived at around midnight, and immediately Robert came to tell me about ""the incident"".Basically her ex came to the party, and you know the rest. 
I've known him since elementary school so I trust him like a brother.
I went inside and I saw my SO in the arms of someone else. When she saw me her face froze.
I didn't have time to think so I went to see Robert and told him I would go.
She called out to me but I left to my appartement.

She called me and left a few message, saying I shouldn't play dead, I should be a grown up and respond to her. She tried to excuse her own behavior, by saying it wasn't her fault and maybe it wasn't maybe he forced himself on her, I don't know... 
I'm kinda lost, I mean I love her, I really do but
I'm hesitant in giving a response, so what should I do?"
7,"We have been together almost 10 years. I have always had an issue with depression and lately it's brought out some major paranoia.

He has low testosterone. His insurance still requires him to pay a lot of money to get any kind of treatment for it. This means we have no sexual relationship. Every once in a while, 3 months or so, he will initiate something, but it's just me giving him a blowjob, that's it. I no longer make advancements towards him because it's hard being constantly rejected of it's too much effort for no satisfaction on my end. This has caused a lot of strain between us, he seems genuinely upset about it.

It has also caused me to be excessively paranoid that he is getting satisfaction elsewhere and he is just no longer attracted to me. We both have gained excess weight and haven't gotten the help we need for it. He carries it well, but he knows I am incredibly insecure about the way I look. Any time I start talking shit about myself he gets upset. The thing is... He makes no effort to tell me he's attracted to me at all or even act like he's attracted to me.

On top of all that, I feel like he has complete access to everything I say and do online or on my phone and I don't have any access to his stuff. I don't know his passwords, I don't know how to unlock his phone. I had changed my passwords earlier this year as well as my phone security and he pestered me until I gave it to him. If I mention anything to him, he gets upset that I don't trust him.

Typing this all out makes me feel like I've been used and manipulated. I get very little satisfaction from this relationship. I can't honestly talk to him about it because he just gets upset and makes me feel like the crazy bad guy. I have no support system, no one to talk to. All of my friends are also friends with him and I don't want people taking sides and that kind of bullshit.

We have issues, we have talked about all these issues and yet nothing is ever resolved. I always end up feeling this way, insecure, jealous, paranoid. I don't know how to just leave."
8,"Some history. My parents divorced when I was young (4 yo), didn’t have the best relationship with my dad for a number of years because my mom fed me lies growing up about him. I finally grew up saw through those lies and see that he’s one of the most caring people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. 

My dad dated and lived with this woman (toxic ex -TE)while I was growing up (10ish to 19ish maybe?), as I look back they were just.. not meant to be. Both working low income jobs, living pay-check, using alcohol and drugs, both unstable and fighting all the time. TE had a son around my age and followed in his mother’s footsteps. Eventually both TE and her son  decided to pick up and leave my dad, they moved back to where they grew up which is where she got back with her ex husband and sons father. Mind you this is states away and my dad said he never had a clue she still had feelings for this guy. It broke my dads heart and he chased after her. She told them they were done and that was the end of it.
Turns out TE and son get into..big trouble to say the least. In and out of Jail a few times, doing HARD drugs and getting into fights. To say I was relieved she was out of my dads life is an understatement. 

Within the 8 years after TE left my dad, my dads whole life and demeanor changed. He got a great job, quit the drugs, has helped his family when others wouldn’t. My dad and I have the best relationship ever now, we talk multiple times a week (I love about 13 hrs away from him) and overall just have a healthier relationship than we ever had. 
Fast forward to about 3 years agoTE’s son shows up on my dads doorstep. Literally walked 30 miles from the jail he just got out of and landed on my dads doorstep (again last time we knew he was back in his home state 17 hrs away) My dad took him in to help him get back on his feet. Took about 2.5 years but finally got a job and quit mooching off my dad and just left. No thank you, took some cash and items and skidadled. Haven’t heard a peep from him in about 6 months. 

Now I find out last night that a full week ago TE did the exact same thing her son did, showed up out of the blue with her two dogs looking to move in with my dad. NO contact in 5ish years? And just thought she could move in. Which turns out she’s been living there FOR A WEEK. 

What hurts me the most, is he waited a week to tell me. He ignored my phone calls and texts. For this woman who he’s had no contact with and drug him down. When he called me I didn’t have some very nice things to say, and apparently she was standing next to him thinking I’d be excited she was back in his life?
Wrong. I want to fly down there and tell her to leave and never come back, but.. he’s a grown man and make his own life choices. I just know she will mooch off him, and act like all is fine and dandy. I am so worried my dad will end up turning down the wrong path again because of her, and I told him as much during our conversation. I just don’t want her to tear down what he’s built up for himself for so many years. 

This post turned out to be way longer than expected and if I didn’t bore you, I thank you for reading as I needed to vent."
9,"I’ve(23M) been talking to this girl for the past 2 months and so far we had a handful of dates. They’re always fun and sometimes it feels like we could’ve talked for days. Anyways I’m terribly bad at remembering stuff so I keep a journal by my side and I usually write down the stuff she likes, doesn’t like, favorite music, etc. 

One of my girl best friends got her hands on it while I was asking for advice. She gave me this WTF face then started telling me how creepy I am and it’s somewhat obsessive. I messed up my last relationship because I couldn’t remember dates or interests to save the life of me. Didn’t want it to happen again. Since then I’ve been hesitant to contact the girl because now it’s in my head that I’m too clingy or invested in something that’s still new. 

Reddit, tell me the truth. Am I crazy?"
10,"This is the stupidest argument I've been in, but I need advice. 

Over the weekend, my mate Nick was having a get together at his place just to catch up with us all. Between Uni and Work, there isn't much time to go out on a Friday night like we use to. 

There was seven people there. Kyle, Nick and I and our girlfriends. Paul didn't bring his girlfriend, Emma. We didn't know why until later that night. 

We were sitting outside next to the pool talking. Paul randomly asked if he could ask the guys a personal question. He asked us if we kiss our girlfriends after a blowjob. We all said yes. And Jade (Nick's girlfriend) chimed in and said if Nick didn't kiss her after oral during sex, she probably wouldn't give him a blowjob to begin with. My girlfriend and Kyle's agreed with her. They said if they have to choose between kissing or blow jobs, they're choosing kissing. 

Paul got upset started to say how gross it is. All this other shit. And basically told us his girlfriend may be breaking up with him because he doesn't like to give her Oral or kiss her during sex. We didn't really know what to say. He got all upset saying we betrayed him and all this other shit. I don't even know what the fuck he's on about. He has this idea that if my dick goes there, my mouth can't. He stormed out and he won't even take my calls or anything. I've known him for years and he's acting like a dickhead 

Do you have any advice?"
11,"When I met my girlfriend 3 years ago, I knew very quickly she was addicted to Instagram. She was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

This didn't really bother me at first - I actually found it kind of hot? Mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - I felt, I guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then I think).

Other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. Every day is punctuated by ""Insta time"" where I'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for Instagram content... It's ridiculous. We've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, I'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. I'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

It was routine stuff, I asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

So the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. She desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. She's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but I didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for IG, she was actually trying to make money from it. I know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

Essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. Before you say it - yes, I'm probably going to break up with her. But the thing is, she's got a really good heart and I genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). Is there anything I can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

Tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an Instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform."
12,"He and I have been a extremely open about our lives since the very beginning. And he has a done a lot to help me come out of my dark phase to a lesser dark phase perhaps and really helped make me a better person. But I think he is constantly asking me to be grateful for it way too much. In the sense that I think he wants me to constantly be thankful that he did what he did. Which I completely am. But him doing this is kind of making me feel the opposite way. 

And so anytime he does anything for me, romantically, I am extremely happy and grateful when it happens but then in the coming days I have to hear things like "" You can't even do this much for your boyfriend, who went so far to bring you this gift"". Which I get, but then I don't understand if I am making too much of a deal about it or he is wrong here?"
13,"So, my girlfriend and I were discussing some things and she brought up how she feels she isn't beautiful and described herself as ""gross"". My gut dropped. I know she is beautiful as hell and I want her to feel the same way about herself. I know that may sound selfish, but I care about her immensely and I want her to not feel so negatively about herself. I used to think the same about myself and I know how much of a toll that can put on your mind. So, I ask; what can I do to help her?   


Thanks guys!"
14,"We have a 13 year old Staffordshire Bull Terrier (looks like a little pitbull) and he has always been in amazing health. My wife makes all it's food, exercises it multiple times a day, and this dog has lived such an amazing life. It has been her best friend since she was 16. 

But he is getting old and is starting to slow down. He recently developed some bumps and such on his legs and we are going to take him into the vet here next week. 

My wife will not handle bad news well, and eventually if he dies, it will crush her. 

How can I best help comfort and support her through bad news that may come out of this vet visit? And be there for her when he dies someday?"
15,"First off, wow. Apparently my thread blew up after I went to sleep. I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. 

Regarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

Thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day. Thanks.

16,"TLDR; boyfriend’s best friend is blatantly hitting on him and is has begun to bother me, but my boyfriend insists his friend is straight and thus refuses to do anything about it. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a couple years now, and we are very happy. He has been friends with his best friend for a few years before he met me, and they have a very close relationship which I was initially very supportive of. However, from observing over the years I have realized there is more to the relationship than I initially believed. 

I know it is wrong to assume people’s sexuality, but I am almost 100% sure his best friend is attracted to men (or at the very least, my boyfriend). This wouldn’t be a problem normally, except he has begun to blatantly disrespect my relationship and overstep boundaries. He has always been fairly cold to me, even though I went out of my way to form a friendship with him. However, recently, he has been going overboard. 

When my boyfriend and I schedule time together which is rare due to our busy schedules, his best friend frequently asks him to cancel and do something with him instead. He is very physically affectionate with my boyfriend (which my boyfriend does not reciprocate), and uses pet names for him which are normally reserved for a relationship. He also makes frequent “jokes” about being gay, my boyfriend being attractive, how my boyfriend should try dating a guy instead of me since women are difficult, etc. 

If my boyfriend and I argue about anything, he pushes for us to break up. He has pointed out before that he is more of a constant in my boyfriend’s life than I am. He is very possessive over my boyfriend, and frequently makes comments to me about how much time they used to spend together/how close they were in a very passive aggressive manner. I consistently get the impression that he accuses me of “stealing away” my boyfriend.

Now that our relationship has progressed further and we are getting serious, his friend has gotten worse as my boyfriend directs most of his attention to me. He is borderline hostile to me and outwardly hits on my boyfriend in a smug manner, and my boyfriend allows it because he insists his friend is straight. He asked my boyfriend to schedule his semester around his classes instead of mine, which is obnoxious. He asks him to leave dates early, invites him over for “dates” to watch shows, splits costs with him for things my boyfriend is going to buy so they have to be together to use them (textbooks, games, etc). 

I just feel so incredibly disrespected. I am not a jealous or vindictive person. I truly wanted to be friends with his best friend, and I had no negative opinions of him until he made his behavior clear once he realized I am not a temporary thing. I do not feel threatened, my partner has never shown signs of wanting to be with anyone else and is assuredly straight. My boyfriend was single his whole life until he met me and I intend to stay. I am at my wits end— I don’t know what to do about his best friend. 

If it doesn’t bother my boyfriend I feel like I should leave it alone, but I feel like it has crossed a line and I need my boyfriend to realize what I (and some of his friends) have noticed. I have no issue with them remaining friends as long as his friend accepts that’s all they’ll ever be. It makes me feel crazy to be “jealous” of a man. Am I going insane and should I just keep this to myself, or is there anything I should do?"
17,"The other evening, around 6 I got a call from my boyfriend’s ex. She told me that she wanted to go out and asked me to please watch her son. My boyfriend is away on a business trip that’s why she didn’t ask him. She told me “I was just going to take him to the bar with me, but if you’ll come over”. I told her I would, my boyfriend’s son is really sweet and I do enjoy spending time with him.

So, she tells me she’ll be home by 10, but she doesn’t come until 1 a.m. 

She asked me where her son was and I told her in bed. Just as I was talking to her, he comes into the living room wide awake. She asked me what time I sent him to bed and I told her 9. She told me “he can go to bed when he wants, you can’t force him to be tired”. I told her I just thought because he is so young he should get some sleep before school, and I told her that that’s what time he goes to bed when he’s with my boyfriend. She just laughed and started to raise her voice, she said “well he’s his father, have your own kids if you want to decide what he gets to do”. I tried to defend myself but I really didn’t know what to say, I was kinda stunned she was so bothered. And then she just yelled at me “leave, just get out of my house please”. I did.

I haven’t told my boyfriend yet, but I want and need to. I just don’t know how I should handle this. I’m so confused and a little hurt. Did I do something wrong? What should I do in the future?"
18,"I (24m) have been with my girlfriend for two years and I strongly want to marry her. 

However, she has recently started talking to her ex again. She broke up with me for him years ago and now they are talking again. 

It makes me really uncomfortable but she just gets mad every time I try and approach the subject. 

I'd ask her to stop but I am not about that life and she'd just use it against me. 

What do I do?"
19,"So I've \[21F\] have liked this guy since around the start of this year, we're not super close but we run in a lot of the same circles (similar majors at college) and have a lot of mutual friends. I was going to tell him when I first starting liking him but I chickened out off the excuse that I didn't think he felt the same way since we don't really talk online a lot but we do when we see each other at events and stuff. I did ask him out for a coffee very recently, but we just talked normally and I didn't admit anything.

So, now I hear he's taken interest in a new girl and has been talking to her online which looks to me like he doesn't see me in that way at all.  I'm not sure if I should just move on or tell him. He's throwing a Halloween party this weekend which I've been invited to and I'm not sure what I should do."
20,"Seems like every relationship I have (friends and family included) I feel as I like/love them way more than they do me.  I don’t know if it makes me appear more needy or desperate or what it may look like from the others view.  It’s not the best feeling to have when you tend to want to love someone so much and seem to kinda just get back a ...mehhh you’re cool vibe. Maybe I just have an unrealistic idea of what a healthy relationship should feel like. Example kinda like I’m always the one calling them, I’m always the one asking to hang out, I’m always the one that text first. But I feel like if I don’t they’d just never contact me. Any advice on the matter will be helpful."
21,"I am against my gf having a sugar daddy. However she wants one. She says I'll never understand what its like not to have money (I'm middle class). She wanted to go shopping in the city 2 hours away for a day, and  also meet with a potential sugar daddy. I told her that I don't like the idea of her being intimate with someone else. My gf got upset at this and after a long back and forth civil argument she concluded with ""I love you and only you me having a relationship with a sugar daddy would not be intimate because I don't love him."" This made me feel really bad because it just sounds like an excuse to cheat.  She told me as well that she would have intercourse with a sugar daddy if they gave her a few thousand. I feel like her saying this puts a price point on our relationship so I told her how I felt. She told me that, that was the stupidest thing I've ever said. She explained again that because she doesn't love the sugar daddy it would not be intimate, but I argued that spending hours talking and having intercourse is intimate by definition. What do you people think about this situation? Am I wrong to feel the way I do?"
22,"I dumped him thursday. He joined a group chat and lived it up with the boys on friday and throughout the weekend. We were arguing and he got mad at me to the point where he thought it was okay to post my private photos on a group chat with his friends. He said he took it down after an hour or so because he felt guilty and that he didn't have to tell me he did that. 

Now he's blocked ME and doesn't want to talk. I'm really angry and betrayed but now im even more pissed that he has the audacity to block me after what he's done. I'm really upset. I don't know how to cope with this right now.

Our entire relationship was a lie. We were planning on getting married. It was a pretty serious relationship, at least on my end.



Edit: the groupchat was on instagram."
23,"
So I just wanted to know if I’m being unreasonable, Our children are ages 6 and 4.

As of now, we all live together until I save up money to move out. I started my job around February and since then I’ve been working every weekend from 7am to 3pm. So naturally they stay home with their dad because he works Monday through Friday from 9am to 5pm. I only have Monday’s off and I work about 60 hours a week.

He says that I’m lucky because I have a day off during the week, but I’m not lucky because I still have to get up early to take the children to school plus I’m the only person that cleans the house so my entire day off is me cleaning the house that’s gotten completely filthy over the week. Now he’s telling me I have to find someone to watch the kids while I work on the weekend, because he never has a day off. He has to get up in the morning to take the kids to school although I’ve already gotten their school clothes ready for him and the school is on his way to work, he gets off at 5pm so he has no time to go out, so I have to find someone to watch them on weekends so he can be able to go out because I go out maybe once or twice every 2 weeks but he never does. 

I just want to know if I’m being unreasonable for not being happy about this, I didn’t choose my schedule. I work almost 60 hours a week with 1 day off. I still have to cook and clean and get the kids school things ready for the next day, and also pick them up from school once I get off everyday while he comes straight home and lay down. And once I get home at 3:30pm he’s still free to do whatever he pleases, it’s not like I’m stopping him. But now I have to find child care or pay for it because he says he can’t watch them anymore every weekend."
24,"Growing up was weird. My parents divorced when I was 5 and my mother tried on and off to be part of my life. She was a druggy alcoholic and the relationship bridge burned before I got to highschool. 

When I was 9, my father met his current wife, my new stepmom. She was great for the first few years. Only stress was from my sister who caused many issues due. She was manipulative and had some personality disorders. When my sister was kicked out after highschool, when I was 13, there was a year of peace. Then my stepmom locked on to me.

From age 14 to 18, it felt like my mom was looking for every small slip up from me. She would hold things against me for months or even years, she would scream at me at full volume saying how I can't do anything right and constantly getting my head out of my ass. She would throw things in anger, belittle me on how I looked or acted (I'm gay and she is not with that), and just make me feel horrible. Whenever we were in the car, she would always open the windows as if I smelled like shit. She would constantly flick my ear or my glasses because she was ""trying to joke around and be friendly"" if we were in the car. This would always only happen when my dad was away. When he would show up, she would change. She would cry and say how I was causing all this stress on her. 

I was terrified to be home. Car rides made me nervous because I couldn't leave. I barely talked and made as little noise as I could.i was scared of my shadow. I counted down the hours until I could be safe and go to sleep. My junior and senior year in highschool, I was highly depressed and suicidal. My mom found out I was self harming my junior year and took me to a doctor for all those pills. They didn't help my soul crushing fear I had of my stepmom though. 

When college came around, I thought I was free, but I wasn't. I had to email home about how I was doing each week, but my mom treated it like a college essay. If I had any issues in it, she would email back tearing me apart, text me in all caps, or call me, screaming over the phone, threatening to show up. Emails scared me. Phone calls scared me. If I saw her contact pop up, I would have a breakdown. As time went on, she started showing up randomly and demand me to show her everything in my dorm. After 2 years, even more self harm, and way too many close calls on top of a parking lot, I decided I was going to drop pout and move away.

Yeah, it's extreme, but I couldn't go home for summer. I was going to kill myself if I did and I say that in all seriousness. I was not going to live another summer with her.

In a last ditch effort, I called my dad and tried to explain all of this through my crying because I was terrified. I didn't want to let my dad down. I didn't want to be a failure. He didn't take it well. Said a man should be afraid of his own mom. He did say he would work on it, but nothing happened. So I left. I told them 3 days before the semester ended and I left. I gave them my new address and that's it. I didn't even tell them why I left. It hurt too much at the time and it still hurts now. 

It has been 2 years and I have been so much better mentally. There hasn't been much communication between us at all. Today is my birthday and I got a really heartfelt email from my father saying he still loves me and all that. Because of this email, I came to a point where I want to tell him why I left. I want to type up a detailed email of how I felt and what had been happening behind walls. I'm just afraid it would ruin his relationship with his wife that he loves and who makes him incredibly happy. Or he could just hate me instead. I just don't want my father to be hurt but I want to come clean.

What should I do?


Edit: Many are asking. My dad worked long hours in the office during the week for half of my childhood. The other half, he was gone for a month at a time, but then home for a month. My stepmom was a monster only when he wasn't around (away from home or away from us completely), no chance of seeing it. Whenever I dealt with this, I would just shut down. If he noticed anything, it was a teenage son getting more and more distant while being told he was a monster. Yeah, when I was away, my stepmom filled his head with over exaggerated stories of how I'm horrible. He didn't know at all."
25,"Hi everyone, 
So I discovered a few weeks ago one of my best friends (m31) I’ve had in my life for around 10 years and has been with his partner for over 12 years has been cheating on her with my housemate (f20) for over 2 years, we had a get together for my friends 31st birthday and I caught the two of them in the act later that night.

The two of them confessed everything to me the next day and said that they both love each other,  my friend made this even more complicated as my housemate (f20) and I were becoming quite good friends, just hanging out watching movies or whatever, also, the three of us work together, my friend (m31) is our manager.

So my friend (m31) told me he had told her (f20) 5 months ago that he never had feelings for her and they need to cool things off, then when he saw myself and her hanging out he couldn’t handle it and told her he did in fact love her and can’t live without her in his life, now my friendship with her feels tarnished and she doesn’t want to spend time with me, I look at him and feel disgusted with his lies and what he’s done to his fiancé.

I also very recently broke up with my partner and haven’t had a lot of time to think about how I’m feeling because of all this, I feel like I’m in a sitcom.

Thanks for reading"
26,"I need help and an outside view. My wife (26)  and I (26) were dating for two and a half years and recently got married. Before the wedding, she constantly complained that she still lives with her parents (this is a common thing where we are from), she does not like our country and she would very much like to leave. After the wedding, I got a good job and the first month we moved to another country. We have our own nice apartment, I have a good salary, the climate is wonderful. But she constantly finds reasons to start a fight with me. I can say some stupid shit, she takes it too much and some little thing turns into a giant problem for weeks.  We have sex three-four times a week, I constantly bring her to an orgasm, but she thinks that I don't want her anymore. Every Tuesday we have team building and I come home from work a maximum of an hour or two later than usual. Therefore, every Tuesday we have a fight about it. Sometimes, very rarely, really, I play video games in my free time and she believes that I spend little time with her. Every Saturday and Sunday we go to the beach. I don’t go anywhere with colleagues without her. For some reason she hates my boss, although he is a wonderful guy. Tell me, am I just misunderstanding something or are these real problems? And is there a way to solve them?

Sorry for my bad English"
27,"My brother has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for around 8 years now. They met when they were in college, and when I was in high school. My brother’s girlfriend brings out the best in my brother, and everyone in my family can’t thank her enough for it. We love her; she’s smart, witty, caring, and overall a great person. Even though my brother and she aren’t engaged, let along married, we treat her as part of the family.

My brother and his girlfriend are taking a week’s vacation, and our house is one of their “stops” along the way. I got to school in the same city as my university, so it’s easy for me to get to our house from my dorm (around a 15-minute drive or so); I was able to leave class early to pick them up from the airport, and drive them back to our house. 

Everyone’s home, we catch up, and we get ready for dinner. My brother and his girlfriend are staying in our guest room. My brother’s girlfriend steps out to take a phone call, going back to the guest room. I go wash my hands, and I hear her from across the hall (our powder room is across the hall from the guest room). I can’t tell who she’s talking to — I assumed it was her parents —anyway, I overhear her say, “Yeah, he picked us up from the airport. He’s joining us for dinner and heading back to campus afterward so I only gotta deal with him for a couple of hours, thank god.” 

“He”, of course, is me.

I’m at a loss. I haven’t told my brother about this yet. I would assume that my brother’s girlfriend has told my brother how she feels about me. It’s so upsetting, though; my brother and I are so close; we love each other so much, I would hate for me to think that he feels this way, too. Maybe he just puts up with her feelings about me? Regardless, I see her as family, and have so for awhile. How long has she felt this way about me? 8 years? I’m so distraught and I don’t know what to do.

tl;dr brother’s girlfriend of 8 years, whom I see as family, doesn’t actually like me, and I’m really upset. I thought we got along really well."
28,"I'm not sure if this is the best sub to ask this, but I've gotten good advice here before so I'm hoping for some feedback. Most of this is what I've been told by my friend, however i have met the child in question a few times. My friend (F23) has been babysitting this young girl (F11) that I'll call Jenny for this, since she was 7 years old. Jenny has always been a bit odd, but generally happy child. Over the past two years however, she's gotten rather...dark. She started self harming two years ago to the point she's had to go to the hospital multiple times for infections and cuts that didn't stop bleeding on their own. All her cuts and scrapes and scratches, when they start to heal she tears at them again. She's very fidgety and like to fidget around with staples, however she then starts to dig into her skin with them until she's bleeding. And the things she says have all just gotten a lot darker sounding. Not normal little girl things I guess.

Then this past Sunday when my friend was babysitting her, Jenny told her that she was ""bleeding down there and it hurts."" My friend assumed that meant she started her period and was cramping, got her a pad and left it at that until her mom got home. She brought it up to her mother who assured her that it's not her period, and they've been to the doctor about it but they don't know what it is. Then quickly changed the topic and ushered my friend out of the house. 

So my friend told me all this because she's concerned, and I felt like it was uncomfortable as well. I'm getting this eery feeling like she's being/been abused and it's coming out in her self harm and whatever this is. Whether she's also harmed her lower bits or someone else has.. we obviously don't know. I told my friend though I think she should report this because it's just not normal. She doesn't think she should though since the mom says she has been to the doctor for all these things and is in therapy for the self harming. 

This isn't sitting right with me. The fact she's changed so much in two years is odd (though I know this is around puberty time) and the self harming and this it just seems off. I kind of want to call myself, but I'm also a little hesitant because if the mother is telling the truth and it's all some medical thing... I'd hate to bring down an investigation on them and put this little girl through all that when there's something she clearly going through mentally, and having her asked if mommy and daddy hurt her could make things worse. And also the fact almost all of this is second hand information, I'm not sure if that's even enough to go on. I don't know what to do. We live in Canada if that info is helpful for any of the advice you may give."
29,"

Ok so I posted yesterday about how we were clubbing with my friends and all our clubs have female dancers. My gf felt insecure all of a sudden and started talking shit about one dancer and then arguing with my friends if they find her attractive. She got mad at me, i told her she embarrassed me and she left.(full story in my post history)

Anyway I wanted to talk to her about it and she says that I as a man should have taken her side. I don’t know what she means? Was I expected to start bashing the female dancer too? 

I told her it’s not a good look to start arguing with my friends like that especially for things that don’t concern her (who finds what attractive).
And she is having none of it. We were texting all of this and she just stopped responding. 

Should I try talking to her again or let her come to me when she is over it?

TL;DR Girlfriend mad at me and I can’t seem to find a way to talk to her. Should I just apologize even if not Sincere ?"
30,"I've tried posting this on Legal advice and a few other places and it was removed. I guess I just need an opinion.

Couple of important notes:

no legal issues, mostly a social matter.

**Story:** Basically a girl I had slept with and shared mutual feelings for roughly 2 years ago has made an allegation of sexual assault against me. This allegation was made due to an event that occurred last year. Our mutual group of friends hosted a birthday party at my house for my accusers now roommate. Lets call accuser A and roommate C. That night A and I had talked about her situation with her boyfriend. We can call him K. A and K have been dating for a while and as a friend and former romantic interest I care about her. A has been abusive to past girlfriends emotionally and physically, never excessive but enough to make myself and our former roommate uncomfortable.

I speak to A a bit about her relationship, let her know I care about her etc. her and K are fighting about something i cant even remember. A sticks around after the party and we make unwise decisions, A and I go skinnydipping, talk about our past and a bunch of shit, end up going back to my house, have a shower together &amp; continue to talk intimately.

We go to bed, start some foreplay and as were about to have sex she says no, not angrily or confrontational but in a deescalating manner. WE STOP having interaction, stay in bed in each others arms, naked. And fall asleep together. Whole ordeal is intimate and consensual.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I had a falling out with K over his abusive demeanor and had since been basically socially exiled from their group of friends. (have plenty of friends of my own tho) Anyways, my roommate is trying to convince me to go to a party with him, i reluctantly agree after a few times of him asking. Ends up being K's house as we pull up to the driveway. I decide fuck it lets go and if anything happens we can just leave later. I expect K to come talk shit about our social beef but instead he drops a bomb: ""You raped A"". I was under the impression they were still dating at the time. Long story short we decide to leave.

Next day I find out a few more things:

rumor has gone around, a lot of people are doubting the rumor cause A has said conflicting things. Some people believe it. C being A's roommate and my close friend decides to ask her a few questions &amp;  explains to me that her view of the situation is as follows:

A had finally admitted to staying the night at my house to K - an event which caused them to break up, C thinks that A has twisted the story to shift blame. Now K thinks im a rapist but still wont get back with A.  

A confesses to me over the phone she used ""Heavy words"" and that it was a ""genuine misunderstanding""

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem and why i need advice:** 

Im a musician and K is a promoter in the area I live in, he contacted all the promoters Im affiliated with and told them im accused of **Multiple** assaults. He sends 2 numbers to the promoters. A &amp; someone elses. I call the second number and ask straightforward whats going on with all this. They confess that they had only told K that I had hit on them once at a party and they were ""in no way accusing of sexual assault"" etc. One down another to go.

A has seemed adamant about not involving any legal action but now I have multiple promoters in the music scene unwilling to work with me. My name is getting DRAGGED through the ground and back over something that A thinks is a social matter. I can no longer get music work. Im afraid to stir the pot with Defamation suits.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTION: How can I respectfully handle this socially going forward as a musician, what should I do other than continuing to be myself. Should I take legal action or just take the High road? Should I try any other means of de-escalating this situation. I need anyone to hear me..**

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; old fling tried to avoid a breakup by blaming spending the night on me via a rape accusation."
31,"**I NEED YOUR OPINION PLEASE, I'M STRUGGLING**

OK, so my friend we will call her Emily recently confessed to me and I am struggling.To be honest I've had hints of feelings for female friends but never sought after them, believed I was as straight as a bean pole. So my crush life has usually consisted of boys. Recent events have made me really look into myself and I believe I am a demisexual, so it's hard for me to actually grow a connection and have feelings for people so this is serious, I usually don't even feel this for anyone but she makes me feel warm and content inside and makes me blush with her compliments. We've known each other for two years and we talk daily, video chat a few times but we're always so nervous. Anyway. Before she even confessed i've been kind of conflicted about feeling these things towards Emily, but since she's told me how she feels well...my heart doesn't know how to respond.(Christian upbringing, you can guess the confliction)

It's been ages and I'm still swinging between just saying ""fuck it, yes I like you too let's do this"" and just staying friends. I just...I just want to know what you think. I'm worried that deep down i just want to be loved and have a relationship (i've been single since birth) But I really do care about her, she's flipping amazing and I adore her...I don't want to hurt her.

SO...should I give it a shot? Do any of you have any tips or suggestions for me to do to determine if I'm actually attracted to her? Should I just ignore it and stay friends for safety sake?"
32,"I was married to my high school girlfriend up until last year. It didn't work out for I what I believe alot of similar marriages don't work out. We were young, dumb,  allegedly in love, and were just trying to force a relationship that was neither healthy or enjoyable for either of us. There were no kids involved, no properties, the divorce was simple and easy.

Fast forward to now and I have met this great girl that I love and feel absolutely great with. It seems like we're perfect for each other for alot of reasons.

However, she has expressed to me that she does not feel special to me because I have "" said and done everything special with another person"". She also tells me that I have not done anything wrong to make her feel unspecial. But that's what bothers her the most, the fact that it's all in her head and that she doesn't know how to get over it.

We've talked about it and she says that she loves me and I've told her I love her. She wants to continue this relationship, but she doesn't want to feel like this anymore. We've both expressed that we're willing to work on it and try and figure out a solution.

Is there any way to remedy this issue? Is this something time will change? Am I being selfish for staying with her if she says she doesn't feel special with me? Can this relationship continue?

TL;DR : My girlfriend says that she doesn't feel special to me because I've been married before. We both want to continue being with each other, any advice?"
33,"As the title says, my **[31/m]** friend **[28/m]** has became an Incel.

Let me elaborate this and sorry for the grammar since english is not my first language. Warning, this is going to be a long post.

So an old friend of mine has slowly became an incel during the last year and a half. He was a normal guy in terms of women, he had a girlfriend, he was training and studying a government exam to became a policeman and working as a cook at the same time. He was joyful and a good guy.

18 months ago he passed the physical tests and the exam to became policeman, but in the last selection baremo, an interview driven in this case by 2 girls (this is important) he was sacked. This 2 girls are kinda known in that world for being biased in favour of woman, not a lot of men get the green light from them and male applicants are afraid of having to do the interview with them. Truth is that a lot of people pass all the test but the government has to thin out the final candidates and a lot of good people (and I guess also bad) get kicked out. Also it's true that a way bigger percentage of women pass this last test than men. Even if the percentage of men passing all the previous tests is bigger, but nowdays the government wants to be more inclusive and get more women to be policeman. Not 100% fair but that's what it is, what are you gonna do. He trained &amp; studied hard for 2 years for that chance.

No long after that his girlfriend left him. You know, the typical, it's not you, bla,bla, bla. A while after he was told that she was fucking others guys and even if I used to like the girl (she was funny and nice to be around), she was a total piece of shit and made him suffer.

So slowly but sureley he started to get in a depression, he is always sadder and sadder. He got another job as cook (tbh is a shitty job and he hates it, but what you gonna do).

I tried to encourage him to train for the policeman tests again but he has always refused so I don't even try anymore. Always that I know of some kind of official examns for government jobs I let him know and encourage him to study them so he can get out of the restaurant life. But he never does.

He has became more and more depressed over time and what is worse, he really despise women. Slowly but sureley he has became a true incel in the last year and a half. His comments about women are becoming worse and worse. Calling all of them who*#es, bitch#*s, ""what do you expect from a woman?"" comments, etc.

I laugh those comments off trying to not entering in conflic with him. But they are becoming more and more prominent as time passes. And his usual group of friends are not helping with it cause they are kinda like that too. He is also becoming more extremist with his political ideas (far right).

I'm trying to help him, some time ago he asked me to go bouldering with him and I did, and I really loved it. Now it's my nº1 hobby but he doesn't practice it anymore. I still play videogames with him and I try to get him to do stuff on his free days (climbing, go to the cinema, go have some beers, etc). But he is kinda refusing every time more and more this offers. 

He is deeply depressed (doesn't want to hang out, told me he doesn't clean his apartament, etc) and I'm trying to get him out of it. He also refuses to go out and try to met a girl, join Tinder, anyhting. He totally refuses, cursing about women and how shitty they are, insulting them every time anything related to them comes into a conversation. I think the interview thing and his exgirlfriend have been a huge toll in his mental health.

I like this guy and he is a good person, but this behaviour is going worse and worse with time, and at this point im kinda embarassed of him (I would never introduce my girlfriend to this guy cause I would be afraid she could think that I share any of his ideas). He is deeply depressed and a total incel and I don't know how to get him out of this toxic loop. I think getting him to know a girl would help him greatly, but I don't know if it's a bit too late since his behaviour towards women is kinda shitty and he is not the cutest guy around either. I don't think I can talk straight to him about this cause he will brush it off or tell me to go to hell and cut his relationship with me. So I'm lost, but I also want him to change before he gets to the point I have to just cut him off of my life.

TLDR: Because of some events related with women and a shitty job, my friend has became an Incel and got into depression in the last year and a half and I don't know how to deal with this."
34,"So over the weekend I (22m) proposed to my girlfriend (24f) and she gladly said yes. She and I used to only see each other once or twice a week and a few weeks ago we moved in together. As a result, we’d been having sex way more often. Usually around 3 or 4 times a week which was great. Since Saturday (when I proposed) we’ve banged I think 12 times. The last two times I could barely keep myself hard and had the weakest orgasms of my life. The last time was right before work (I’m posting this during my lunch break) and since then I’ve just felt terrible. Sort of like a super long post nut clarity. 

I love my fiancee but I’m sort of worried that I’m finding her less attractive given how I’ve felt in the last few hours. Now I’ve never been an especially horny guy. Even when I was in puberty and had just discovered porn I’d only jerk it once a day or so. And since turning 19/20 I’d only crave sex a few times a week. I hope I’m just getting too much of a good thing over the last few days and after the euphoria of being engaged wears off my brain and genitals will get in agreement and calm down again. I’ll take any input you guys can offer"
35,"This is going to be awfully weird to explain and some of you may jump to conclusions and judge me but please read the whole thing before making assumption.

I've always wanted to do amateur porn videos and I've been upfront about that with my boyfriend. My boyfriend, when I told him about it, was all about it. We both work in a field where even if said videos are found, it wouldn't jeopardize our careers. He was even excited about the idea and I was happy I can do something as a side-job, more or less, that I really enjoy.

The deal was really simple. We do the videos, we upload them and the revenue we gets split between the two of us equally. We've been uploading videos for the past four months now; even got our account verified and even though we don't make a lot of money from it, it's actually not bad considering we both have full time jobs elsewhere.

As a side note, I do most of the ""heavy lifting"" meaning I edit, upload the videos and his face is also hidden in them.

Yesterday, when I tried to log in my account it said my password is incorrect. I later found out the email has been changed and when I confronted my boyfriend he got extremely angry with me and told me his friends and work friends found the channel and he changed everything-- he even went as far as deleting all the videos on it. I kinda broke down because I've invested a lot of work and effort in our mutual hobby and channel but he didn't care one bit despite knowing how much the channel and the hobby as a whole means to me.

He's not willing to discuss it, I'm not sure how to get the account back and I don't even have access of all the videos I had planned to edit and upload. He isn't budging one bit and isn't willing to sit down and have a grown up talk despite him agreeing to it even though I explicitly said it's not a deal breaker if he isn't comfortable with his girlfriend uploading videos on the internet.

Last but not least, the worst part of it, he even tried to get my whole setup (camera, lighting and everything) even though I paid for everything out of my own pocket.

I need help handling this situation; I'm even willing to do something about it through the law.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's friends found out we share and upload pornography videos on a joint account, he has since taken the account we created together and deleted everything on it. He isn't willing to discuss it further and I'm not sure how to get my account back."
36,"I am about to get married, and with divorce rates at like 50% I was wondering if anyone who has been with their partner for a long time have any tips with keeping the longevity of the marriage."
37,"My son has Asperger's syndrome but he lives on his own and has a job.  However, he needs me on a fairly regular basis and is comforted to stop off at my home and see me and the cat (who is 16 years old) b/c he has OCD as well.  His dad passed away several years ago.

I had been dating someone and my son had me to himself every Sunday night and slept over.  With my new boyfriend, it's different b/c he lives a distance so I don't see him during the week but he visits from Friday and sometimes stays over on Sundays into early Monday AM.

My son isn't comfortable with the new bf yet and is concerned that he won't see me as he's done in the past.  

I've told my new bf about my son but I don't want to scare him off either.

Should I ask him not to stay over on Sunday nights or at least not every one?  Also, do you think he'd be put off if I asked him if it was OK if my son visited a while during the day on Sundays?"
38,"We dated for 6-years, got married - married for 15 years - now separated for 3-months.  He was an undiagnosed manic depressive BP.  Things were not great for a long time &amp; coupled with a pill addiction, gambling addiction and lots of lies caused A LOT of issues.  The breaking point was the night I told him I wanted to separate - he had taken some pills that night &amp; completely trashed the house, dragged me around the house threatening me &amp; all kinds of CRAZY.  I was scared for my life.  We have a 4-yr old child too, who was in the house that night also. 

We’ve both been in therapy, he’s been getting treatment for his issues.  The thing I think about is that I cannot get over that this is how things turned out for me.  I feel bad for our child having to be whiteness to the crazy behavior.  I wonder if he’ll be ok.  I don’t want to get close to people.  I don’t want to be alone either. I definitely could not ever be living with his dad.  To which btw he cannot believe I want nothing to do with him. 

I guess I’m just wondering if you ever trust again , or feel safe &amp; secure after all of the abuse."
39,"Summary of previous post: bf suddenly broke up with me without a clear explanation. 

A few months have passed. There was a period of texting and we even met once - in this instance, my ex seemed in love with me as before, which really confused me. He even kissed me. There was there a month of 0 contact, after I had a burst of anger due to the confusion that his unexpected affection had caused. 
After this month of 0 texts and calls, we met at a work event. Again, he behaved like he was in love with me. He revealed though that this other girl who he was texting whilst we were still together grew closer to him, and that they went on dates, cuddled in the same bed and kissed. She had asked for him to be her boyfriend several times, to which he said he 'wasn't ready'. He said he doesn't feel anything real for this girl because he still loves me. He said that the reason why he left me is that he is depressed and wanted to be alone to improve, but that he is failing at it and feels guilty for causing me so much pain. You can see how confused and broken this left me. According to his story, he broke up with me for depression, was feeling lonely and looked for affection into another woman, and currently still loves me but feels too guilty about what happened with me. I don't know where to go from here. I said I would be willing to ignore all of this and give it a try to get back together, but I don't think he really wants to. He said he needs to improve and work on himself and that I should look for someone better. Any advice on what to do with this knowledge?"
40,"**Brief summary of our relationship before I start:**

Been together for about a year the relationship has been good, but he has done some things to make me thing he is somewhat of an asshole, however they have been discussed and we have generally worked out compromises with it. He is doing his best to make things better and I have seen improvement. Overall he treats me well, constantly compliments me, tells me he loves me and cares about me. He isn't an alcoholic or anything, he mainly drinks for events or drinks on the weekends.

**Main issues:**

**1)**

So basically my bf sometimes strikes me as the type of person who will use drinking as an excuse to justify his behavior, maybe not to the extent that some other people will, but to the point where I still find it to be a bad excuse. I found out shortly after we started dating that he smokes every once in a while (cigars, cigs, vape) when he is drinking. I thought he did not smoke AT ALL so I was kind of put off by this bc he acted like he never smoked. He basically blames being drunk for him smoking a cigar and acts like drinking makes him smoke.

The other night he goes ""yeah you've never been drunk enough to smoke a cigar."" Which in reality, yes I have been drunk enough to smoke one(whatever that means) but I don't, because I don't find smoking appealing. He basically made it seem like I must not be drunk enough if I didn't smoke a cigar, when in reality I don't need to use that as an excuse to smoke, unlike him.

I wouldn't even say that it is smoking I have an issue with really, it is his need to justify his actions with being drunk. I get that some people like smoking when they drink, but he acts like the alcohol forces him to do things, when it is him doing these things. I think that is the reason why the idea of him smoking stuff is a turn off for me, is because he comes off as kind of a jack ass making it seem like he was forced to do it.

**2)**

Once when I was over his house for a party, we were all drunk and I was saying goofy things about how I make a ton of money(it was a joke) and then he kept telling everyone how I really work at a chain restaurant, which I do, but he seemed like he wanted to ruin it and make me look bad so he could be right. Then he was saying ""you haven't even finished school"" and being a dick and I was like ""I am much further in school than you are"" and he goes ""how much do you make a year?"" he was being a douche bag over basically nothing. Like I didn't even insult anyone with the joke I made in the beginning.

**3)**

We were at a formal event for his job and he was drunk there by the time we left. On the car ride home I was talking about something and he goes ""you don't know shit about x."" Which really made me angry, like why would he say that to me in front of two of his other friends especially? Like I feel like he can't control himself when he is drinking. Since then, he has apologized but it just feels like the scars are still there with this stuff. Can I believe that he will be better?

I was starting to think that maybe he just doesn't learn from his actions because just the other night he said something again about how being drunk makes him smoke, leading me to believe that maybe he just will always be this stupid.

**4)**

We were t a bar together one night and he started an argument about politics, which we had both agree to not get into that type of debate and he did it anyway, which annoyed me. I brought it up to him about it later in the week and he goes ""I was drinking"" and I said ""so that excuses it?"" He also told me that once he was at a music festival and these girls approached him trying to get liquor from him and he basically told them to fuck off and I was like ""really?"" and he goes ""I was drunk."" Like yes, I get being drunk can make you different, but stop using it as an excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My bf isn't an alcoholic or anything, but I feel like he is a bad drunk because he acts like being drunk make shim do things he doesn't want to do. He just all around has the tendency to act like a douche bag when he is drinking, and I do not like this."
41,"Hi Reddit !

First of all, English isn't my first language, so I apologize in advance for any grammar mistake.


I met my(22F) boyfriend(32M) 8 months ago through a dating app, since then we have been really in love and spend a lot of time together. I'm so happy with him, it's the first time I fell in love again after a really abusive relationship that ended 2 years ago and I can't thank him enough for helping me overcoming it with all his attention and love. 


For a few years before we met, he had been really fit, going to the gym several times a week and liked his body. A few months before I met him he gained a few pounds (maybe 30 pounds in a year until today) and stopped doing sports, so I never saw him with this type of body that he liked so much. His body was never an issue for me, I find him gorgeous from head to toe, I've never been a huge fan of really muscular bodies anyway. He still have muscles but yeah he is not as fit as he used to be, with a little belly and a butt that I just adore. But he is not fat or anything, maybe a little chubby but again we can still see that he has muscles, he's just not as """"""""perfect"""""""" as he used to be. I know that it is normal, he is 32, he is aging a bit and being in this relationship for a few months hasn't helped because we tend to treat ourselves sometimes. We also drink a few beers a week ,which can't be so good for the belly.


So here's the deal. I know that he was a bit self conscious about it when we met, he made some jokes about it, but it didn't seem to be such a big issue. The problem is that in his entourage people have started to make comments about it. Sometimes it's just some jokes but it has become reccurent and even mean, according to me. I would personnally never point out this kind of thing to people I like or work with. Some of his friends, his mom and even coworkers started to say to him that he had gain pounds which I find awful to say. I they were really concerned about his health or else, I would understand they mentionned it, but most of the time, it seems to be just petty remarks. 


I know that it is starting to make him really Bad about himself. He told me that he doesn't find himself attractive anymore and gets really angry at himself about it. It affects his mental health (he his also about to change job so it doesn't help) and he his really sad, maybe even depressed.  Our sex life has been affected too, he has trouble engaging in sex because of it. I try my best to reassure him by telling him that he is beautiful in every way and by making positive comments about his body and his looks in general, but it doesn't help much. Even if I'm not a big fan of sports, I even told him that we could go run together sometimes if it could help him feel better but we still haven't done anything. 

Today he sent me a message about a coworker who made a nasty comment about him enlarging and I saw that he was really hurt by it, telling me about how he needs to go on diet. At this point I'm just not sure if diet will help him being happier, he seems to have other issues about his looks (like with his grey hair or balding which is normal at his age) and I'm afraid that he won't love himself even After losing weight. I just don't know what I can do to help him anymore and I'm worried about him. With all the stress from work + this issue, he seems to be in a Bad place and I worry about a depression.

Please Reddit give me all your best advice on how to deal with this issue and how to help him feel more okay about himself, I just want him to realize how amazing he is ❤️

TL;DR : My bf has gained weight and is very self conscious about it. His entourage doesn't help, because of the comments they make about it. I worry that, this added to all the troubles at work, could lead to depression. How Can I help him ?"
42,"Wednesday(it's now Friday here) my best friend asked me if I'd go out with her. I didn't really know what to do at the time so I said I needed some time to think because it was a serious surprise.

I've been thinking about it and she is amazing in every way, I'd be lucky to get the chance and I'm already the luckiest person I know for her to even want me like that, but I'm not sure what the right decision is. She's gorgeous, smart, entertaining, all the normal stuff but also all the little stupid details that make her perfect and I think I want to, but I'm worried it might have a negative effect on our existing relationship if something goes wrong.

I would love to hear other thoughts and opinions on my situation to help me make my decision.
Thanks."
43,"So to my surprise, my gf and I split a few months ago after being together for over 2 years over situational circumstances that left both of us really hurt and confused about what our future will look like. Since we had both known each other well before we started dating and we just click on so many different levels we decided to stay friends. It took a lot of healing and talking about our feelings but I feel like we’ve reached a semi-comfortable stage in rebuilding this relationship. I still have many restless nights and intrusive thoughts but I know this is only natural and much better than suppressing my own emotions.

So with that out of the way, here is where my problem arises. What would have been our third anniversary is coming up in a few months and I don’t have a doubt in my mind that she won’t forget it because it also happens to fall on the same day as a holiday. Since I’ve been busy juggling school and work, a few months ago (roughly a month before we broke up) I decided to get a head start on her anniversary present. Since we were long distance for a good portion of our relationship, I thought it would be cute to create a little scrapbook of some of our text conversations, which includes lovey dovey stuff, our inside jokes, pictures of us and our pets, as well as some amateurish poetry and a drawing I made of her. I poured my heart and soul into this book and by the time we broke up I had completed about 90% of it. When the break up was still fresh and my emotions were running very high I almost scrapped it all, but Ive since come to my senses and realized that this girl is still a very important part of my life and she is my by far my dearest, most cherished friend. 

So I guess my question is do I still give her the present? I know I could edit out all the lovey mushy stuff and leave the rest in but I feel like it would take away from what I was trying to convey when I created it. I feel like I would be better off giving it to her in the way it was intended to or not at all."
44,"Note: We know we need counseling and are waiting for the scheduler to call me back and set appointments with us, so we already know that’s a huge priority rn.

Without getting into the details (it’s a long ass story and depending on which one of us is telling it, the other one always sounds awful even if we’re trying not to paint it that way I guess), my spouse and I have been going through some tough times. 

Of the many, one of the issues she had was that I would make friends in FB groups and when sad or depressed would talk to them about my issues, whatever was up (not just marriage things, but whatever. They are real friends imo). My thinking was that we have a lot of mutual friends and I don’t want my one-sided venting to influence THEIR relationship to her, so I opted for people who in no way affected anything irl.

She was furious and said she didn’t feel comfortable with me talking to complete strangers about our personal issues, and that it should be our friends or people who DO know the two of us. 

Okay, fair enough I guess. I can see some arguments one could make for that. 

BUT then when we were arguing she name dropped a few of our best friends in a very “see? THEY think you’re being like X, Y, and Z too!” Which I thought was sort of a shitty card to play. 

THEN I talked to our friends myself (not like in response to her statement, just because I wanted to really give it a try like my spouse wanted). 

I opened up to one couple and then one single friend about being physically abused a few times (5 or fewer times, only one realm ass-kicking, mostly slaps or shoves, and hasn’t happened in like 2 years), and sent screen shots of our text messages where she is saying awfully toxic and abusive shit, and all of this as an attempt to “reach out to our friends instead of strangers.”

Now my spouse is furious that all our friends think she’s violent and controlling and unfair, but like, WTF did she expect to happen? This is literally the EXACT reason I opted for internet friends a thousand miles away...

So in short, idk who I can talk to other than a licensed counselor together with her, but that’s just not enough. I HAVE to talk about things with someone casually in order to process how I feel and whatnot so I NEED to be able to talk to more than just someone paid to listen, but I feel screwed either way."
45,"We were chatting at a bar with a group of friends and the topic of truth and dare came up.

Everyone had a story about a truth or dare, before my girlfriend proclaims ‘well I once gave someone a blowjob as a dare’. Everyone was kind of shocked, but she kept on giving details and saying how she felt bad after and cried, but doesn’t mind because he (the guy) was fit. She did say it was years ago.

I bought it up to her when we got back to the room and she simply said ‘if you can’t accept my past, then you can’t accept me’. I said that I felt humiliated and a bit crap that she would broadcast that in front of friends. 

Is this an issue or am I making it one? 

TLDR; girlfriend said she gave a blowjob to someone for a dare in front of a group of mutual friends."
46,"I’ve (25) been with my wonderful girlfriend (24) for just over a year. It’s cliche but she is the most amazing person I could ask for. She was always honest from the start about her PMDD.  For those not aware it’s a very rare condition which effect 1% of woman and is like PMS on steroids with the most extreme mood swings and the horrific anger. But I’ve always put up with it every month because i love her 

My girlfriend is suppose take a SSRI for her pmdd. She doesn’t. She very anti antidepressants. Which I still don’t understand.  But I respect her choice
She refuses to go back to the doctors she’s doesn’t want to be on pill. I don’t know why. I myself am on her same tablet for depression which is ironic. So it’s definitely no big deal to me.

However over the last 2 months it has got so much worse. We have both had a lot of stress laterly, both finishing are Master Degree and job hunting. Unfortunately she has had a worse time than me. But I’ve always supported her. 

I know I might sound like a mug but I did all her university work for her, I pay for holiday and treat her like a queen. Her behaviour has been so out of control, and I think she’s taken her unhappiness on me. 

She’s had a go at me for everything from being selfish for not being able to afford a music festival (both where jobless, and I paid for a holiday) and the grade she got in her work, which I did because she struggled with. She’s mocked my family because my dad wasn’t able to give her a job.  Called me a embarrassment because I went to a protest ralley against brexit 😳). Always brings up my ex and said they where lucky with out me. Says she wishes she could of punched me in the faces

But it’s not even the arguments, I’ve been called everything from cancer,  disgusting, evil, spinless and a waste of a person. But it’s stuff like being called half a man that really hurts me, I’ve felt emasculated and crushed by the digs on everything from my appearance to my friends and it has really got me down

It’s got so normal for me.

I’ve told her how much it’s hurting me. But nothing changes at all.  But I am spineless I keep going back. I feel drained and so shit. I can’t cope anymore with the constant argument and being verbally attacked

I just want to know what is abuse? Is it abuse"
47,"This is my first serious relationship, we've been together for about 3months now and we want to keep sex till after marriage. The advice I want from you guys is, how do I be more dominant when making out?

She enjoys being the sub and tells me stuff like trying to pin her against the wall/bed when making out. But I feel like she wants to explore other things and to spice it up every now and again. I've tried google but it's all articles about women being more dom and not the other way around.

Also another thing she kinda makes fun off is how vanilla I am because I don't really have any kinks/turn ons besides the neck. So I'm open to suggestions and trying things out, so please, go wild with suggestions.

Tldr: GF wants to try more things and me to be more dom. Need tips on how and also what turn ons guys might have and enjoy."
48," My (ex i guess now) gf has been in 2 previous relationships 3 years each. They both treated her like crap. One of them had schizophrenia and the other was an insecure emotionally unavailable douche. We also work together...  
When she’s with me it’s a change of pace and it scares her. She’s not used to someone treating her with respect on a consistent basis. She sometimes talks about the fucked-up things they did to her nonchalantly like what she experienced wasn’t that bad (it was) . She talks about them quite a bit, and idk if I come off as insecure if I tell her to stop talking about it, but I don’t say anything even though it bothers me sometimes. We have fun. She told me I make her really happy and her behavior proves it. Sometimes, she goes out her way to do things for me and I tell her every time how much I appreciate her.

  
3 weeks ago, she was basically ignoring me for a whole week and then when she wanted me to come over. She basically said she still loved me, but wanted some time to herself and felt that she was jumping in this too fast. I think it scared her that she fell in love with me (she told me she did). I think she was afraid that she’ll be hurt again. Or maybe she just got tired of me. I can be a handful sometimes.  
It all recently stemmed from this: I was interested in potentially moving to a new city and starting a new job and she initially wanted to follow me, but got scared that she decided so quickly to do just that and it gave her anxiety. I guess she didn’t trust herself. It would’ve been cool for her to join me but I knew she’d be sacrificing what she wanted to do and I told her that. To me, she's scared that if something goes wrong and we break up, she'll be stuck in a city where she's unhappy, which is very understandable.

I never wanted to come off as pressuring her to make a decision like that. I keep over analyzing if I came off as needy around her or if she actually had a bunch of issues being with those dudes before me. Sometimes I worry if she's already talking to someone else already. If she did, how would she get over her issues from past relationships? Maybe she lied to soften the blow when we called it off. I initiated the breakup, but I feel like I had to. I still feel like i was dumped.  She kept subtweeting on twitter about relationships which very much correlate what we're going through. Even though i didn't follow her anymore I kept looking at her page. I couldn't handle it , so I gave up Twitter entirely. We sit across from each other at work and it makes it really hard to move on even if we don't talk. I haven't talked to her in a week. I honestly don't know what to do in that situation. I giving her a lot of space. I don't think is does me any good chasing and persuading her to get back with me. She has to do it because it comes off as genuine and something that SHE wants.

I don't know what to do. My mind is focusing on the possibilities of us getting back together, but i'm not too sure how realistic that is.... Any advice will be appreciative"
49,"Ive been in a relattionship with a guy for about 7 months now. I absolutely adore him and its the happiest Ive been in a very long time but hes been acting flaky and pulling away lately. The other day it finally reached a boiling point and he told me that hes aromantic and will never love me. He cares for me but that I have to be ok that this wont change. He told me he wants to stay with me but its my choice if I can stand to be with someone I know will never love me. I honestly believe him and know better than to think I can change him or that he will grow to love me but I dont want to give him up. I dont know what to do.

Update: Youre all right. Thank you for your comments. Ive gotta end it with this guy."
50,"My now ex-boyfriend (42M) asked me (41F) a rhetorical question.  If he was to get cancer would I be his caregiver and take care of him? I said no. I explained my answer of course. I've been a caregiver in a hospital for 13 years now. Getting pretty burned out. My career is very stressful.  I also have 4 children and have been a single mom for about six years now. I told him I would hire a nurse to help out with everything.  I would still love him and support him but I didn't want to be a full time caregiver to him. 
He says I am selfish.  That any friend would do it for a friend. That any good partner or married couple would do it for eachother.  I told him he didn't have the reference points for comparison, to know what it is really like to provide care like that because he has no kids and works in a call center. 
He brought it up again when we broke up. Saying he knew then that I was selfish.  Am I? 

[TLDR]  Is not wanting to be a caregiver for a loved one selfish?"
51,"My ex an I were in a relationship for three months and dating for four before that.  

We weren't exclusive during those four months, and we were just casually dating. After four months, I realized how happy she made me, and decided that I wanted to make it official. So I asked her to be my girlfriend. She smiled and said she really liked me but she wasn't sure she wanted to put a title on things, and asked if I would give her the weekend to think about it.  

I figured it was a blow off, but on that Sunday she called me up and said she was absolutely sure the answer was yes.  

We've been very happy and things have gone well, other than that we hadn't had sex yet. She said she wanted to wait until she was ready, which I've been cool with. I understand it, or at least I thought I did.  

So this past weekend, she decided she was ready. I planned a big romantic dinner, took her to see a play, and showed her a very nice time.  

As we got back to my place, I joked that I was glad she was ready because it had been about a year for me. She laughed and said, ""Yeah, I'm sorry.""  

I replied that it was ok and that I respected that she had to be ready because it was probably a while for her too. She started averting her gaze and said, ""Well, not as long as you."" 

I responded, ""We've been involved for seven months. How much not as long?""  

She wanted to drop the subject, but I was upset and kept pressing. She finally admitted that she had been seeing me and someone else at the beginning. She liked me more, but she already had a date set up with this other guy that weekend when I asked her.  

Her friend advised her to go on the date, have sex with the guy, get it out of her system, and say yes to me after so it wouldn't be cheating.  She did exactly this, ended it with him, and called me up after.  

I told her to get out of my car. She started sobbing and apologizing saying that it was a mistake. I told her I didn't care. I told her that she lied to me, as far as I'm concerned she absolutely did cheat, she buried it for three months, and then acted like sex was something special and important to her when in actuality it was something to get out of her system with someone else.  

I told her it was over and I never wanted to see her again. She begged me to forgive her and I told her it's not happening.  

She's texted me numerous apologies saying she wishes she could go back and change it and I've ignored her. Her friend, yes the one that gave her the advice, called me up and said that I should be mad at her and not my ex. I replied that I actually am angry with both of them because they are both terrible people.  

A friend of mine told me that I was overreacting and we weren't exclusive until she said yes, but that feels like such contrived garbage to me that I won't even hear it. Am I overreacting? Did I make the right choice?"
52,"First I should say that we meet in Japan and we have been dating for 4 months now. In November he's going back home and he invited me to stay with him and he's family for some days.
The things is, that I'm from Mexico and I'm not really sure how is the family culture in the States. But here in Mexico we usually give a present to the ones that are going to receive us in their house, is a way of showing them that you are greatful for letting you stay. I'm planning to buy something traditional that they can use to decorate the house.
My problem is that I'm not really sure how I should to tell them that I bought a present for them, if I should buy something for everyone or even ask my boyfriend if it's fine if i buy something for them.
I hope someone can give me some advice!"
53,"I made a post that got a little popular and mentioned in passing. He asked me to show him, but I was hesitant bc I don’t feel comfortable sharing my username with anyone. He kept on insisting, then accused me of hiding things from him, and then forced me to show him.

I just got really upset because it took me years to get comfortable in this community. I was able to freely participate in discussions and ask questions behind a barrier of anonymity. But I feel like it’s shattered now."
54,"I have been struggling with depression for the last 3 years, there were worse times and there were better times.

For over 2 years now, my SO doesn't want me anymore. We will have sex maybe 5 times a year, always if I beg for it.

3 months ago, after a business trip, SO came home to tell me he met someone and was in love. Promised they had not been intimate, but couldn't stop thinking or talking to someone else.

We had the first honest conversation in months. SO believed I was too fragile to tell me their true feelings, but unleashed on me how it was impossible to see me as depressed dead fish and still feel attracted.

I was taken by surprise, we separated for a week when SO came back saying we should try couples therapy. We are trying it. But I feel so lonely and unloved in this marriage and I know I should be trying to be extra to save it, but I can't be sexier or happier to save my marriage because I am too depressed.

Is there still hope? I have been constantly thinking about just killing myself and ending the pain."
55,A week ago our friend group consisting of both guys and girls decided to go to the pool where one of  my female friends decided to pull a prank on me. She told me she has a surprise for me and made me close my eyes and put hands on them and when I did she pulled down my trunks along with underwear and everyone laughed and gave her high fives. Now I'm mad at her for it and she says I'm overreacting and making this an issue for no reason and the rest of my friends agree and some guys even jokingly recommended getting her back. I don't want this to affect my friendship with others too so what should I do?
56,"
I know this may not sound like a big deal, but it’s been stressing me out way more than it should, and I just need to vent about it. 

So I (17M) have kinda had feelings for my friend (17F) for a while, but about a month or so ago I really fell for her. I care about her, and I want to put our friendship first, but I started having intrusive thoughts about her and our other friend (17M). I noticed 17M and her were starting to get close (that’s fine, like I said I care about them both as friends, and I don’t want to jeopardize that), but I did tell him that I liked her a few weeks ago just so my own thoughts wouldn’t drive me  crazy. 

I apologized to him in advance in case I made any rash decisions out of envy, and we both agreed that our friendships would be our top priorities. He was cool about it, and I told him that I was trying to get over 17F. However, last week, because the topic came up with just the two of us, I told 17F how I feel. Again, we agreed that we should all stay friends no matter what happens. She also said that she likes 17M, to which I said that as long as the three of us continued to be close friends like we were before, then I couldn’t care less. I also told her that I would be trying to get over her, and see her as a close friend rather than an interest. 

Should be fine, right? Nope. One of the reasons I confessed in the first place was so that I could get over her. This week has been painful for me, because now I feel like I fell for her all over again. She and 17M still are just friends (and if they were an item, I want to be in a position where that’s fine by me), but every time I see them together or I hear about conversations between the two of them, I’m finding myself more jealous than I should be. 

While 17M is still super chill about everything, I’m worried that every time I talk with 17F there’s just this awkwardness between us, and, even worse, I’m scaring her off (she was abused and manipulated in a previous relationship, so I get why she would be cautious around guys, even her close friends). Maybe it’s just because I’ve been stabbed in the back by “friends” several times before (or just anxiety in general) but I’m worried that I’ll lose both of them. They’re the two closest friends I’ve had, the only people outside of my family I feel I can trust, and literally one of the reasons I survived high school. 

No matter what happens between 17F and 17M, I just want our friendship go back to normal, especially with 17F. I wish I never caught feelings for her, and I want to get over her, but recently it’s been worse than ever. I’m just scared that I’m pushing away the two greatest people I’ve ever gotten to call friends."
57,"Throwaway. 

I (26M) met a girl(28F) about 3 months ago. We hit it off immediately, I connected with her like I never have experienced before. I’ve dated other girls in the past for longer time frames but I’ve never experienced as intense feelings as this situation.   I’ve never been one to express myself or communicate properly yet it all just seemed to come out naturally with her. 

All has been going well, we talked everyday, we hung out as often as we could. In person we would talk for hours, the sex was fantastic, and we were both being open and honest. 

When I met her I found out she had recently gotten out of a relationship. I was hesitant and reluctant at first simply because I’ve seen those kind of situations play out. I communicated my concern and was reassured multiple times it wasn’t a good previous relationship, that they were done long before they officially broke up. I definitely didn’t want to be a rebound but she initiated that talk with me to not sleep with other people and that she wasn’t looking to just mess around and didn’t want that type of relationship which I was completely on board with both.  She said so many sweet nothings to me that I couldn’t help but having my feelings for her continue to grow to levels I didn’t know I could reach. 

We met each other’s friends, we had numerous amazing dates and nights together. For all intents and purposes we were dating but never officially put a “title” on it. 

Fast forward to now and I had a great weekend with her, followed up with limited communication all week. Finally got a hold of her and she blindsided me that she doesn’t want to do this anymore. She needs to find herself, it’s not about me it’s about her following her gut to be alone. 

I’m just really at a loss and don’t know how to handle this. I’ve never been one to fall deeply so quickly. I understand it hasn’t been all that long and I need to get a grip, but we talked about where we were at multiple times.  She never once gave me any indication she had her foot out the door already. She always acted as into me as I was to her, she told me things that made me think this can’t be coming to an end until it ultimately did.

I don’t know what to do.  This put me into a rough place and I just feel really dejected I truly think she might have been the one for me."
58,"Backstory: Growing up, my relationship with men was pretty messy, after being sexually abused as a child.

After speaking over texts for a few months we finally met up. As soon as I saw him I felt comfort. For the first time there was no over thinking or strategy. I felt myself detach from my ego and completely open up to him - in the sense that for those moments I could no longer identify with fear or insecurity; I finally allowed myself to just be. I’ve never felt so at peace around someone, like I could be myself completely. I felt a sense of safety that I didn’t know I could feel. Very cliche but, it just felt so right,

And that was the first and last time I saw him. Many months later I’m struggling to let go and I’m wondering if it’s because of that particular experience. What did it mean? Will I find it again?"
59,"So for context we’ve been together for just under 2 months but he’s my favorite person in the world. Prior to me, it’s been 2 years since he’s been in a relationship.

Tonight we were walking around Walmart and I had his phone and took really dumb pictures of him because I was just messing with him and when I went to post them on ig for fun I saw half naked women on his feed. I wouldn’t have cared if it weren’t for the fact that I scrolled through the accounts and noticed that he had liked multiple pictures of half naked women. He said that it’s because it’s been 2 years since he’d had anything and I would have believed him if it weren’t for the fact that every picture that he liked that I’d found have been posted after we got together. 

I’m already incredibly insecure and he knows this. These women were beautiful, had flat stomachs, big butts/boobs, basically everything I’ll never be or have. I’m not angry at him for this because he’s an adult and I probably shouldn’t have started scrolling through his feed to begin with but it’s 3 am and he’s in my bed while I’m crying in the bathroom about my looks. Any tips to move past this? We started cuddling and after he kissed me I told him I needed to use the bathroom and that’s when I broke down and started writing this."
60,"TL;DR – My husband has ADD and I am barely hanging on to our marriage. I’m searching for hope, but mostly truth.

This is going to be long, my apologies and thanks ahead of time for reading.

Backstory that is relevant –

Husband and I have been together nearly nine years. I’ve known from the beginning that he has ADD. I also have a mental disorder-though through therapy and medication I would say that it doesn’t impact my day to day living. We also have two children, ages 6 and 5.

The issue –

He is completely unreliable and basically my third child. He was taking medication when we started dating and then just stopped because he didn’t want to take pills anymore. He did not talk to me about this decision at all, just decided that he was done with them. That was years ago and after a year or so of that I finally asked him if he would try to get back on meds because I felt like all the responsibilities fell on me and it was overwhelming. He went back on the meds for maybe a year and then stopped again because he didn’t like how they made him feel, again without any conversation about this.

I can understand why he might not want to be on meds, with my own I no longer have the very high highs or the very low lows but I’m also not having panic attacks daily and I am able to function so it’s a sacrifice I give willingly. I told him that I support his not wanting to be on meds, especially since they made him feel even more depressed, but that if he wasn’t going to do that then he needed to figure out a different way to manage his ADD because it can’t go back to me just being responsible for it all.

This has not gone well at all. He forgets everything, almost constantly. Our home is in a constant state of disarray. I’m not talking about “oh he isn’t doing his share” Im saying he actively makes cleaning up harder. He will make a sandwich and leave the meat out so we have to throw it away when I discover (hours later) that its on the counter. He opens packages and just leaves the trash where he opened it. Opens cupboards and doesn’t close them. Gets dressed and leaves all of his clothes where ever he took them off. Lets the kids rip up paper and throw it around the house and just walks around it until I tell the kids to clean their mess, or if I come home after they are in bed then I basically have to ask him to do it or clean it myself. Its like he doesn’t even see it and when I ask him WTH, he says that he doesn’t think about it…

Speaking of the kids. When I am at work he lets them watch TV the entire time I am gone despite us talking about how we shouldn’t do that. He doesn’t punish them-ever. He will yell at them and threaten punishments (time out, taking a toy away, taking away privileges) but never follows through. In the morning, afternoon, or at bedtime they need to go to the restroom but he forgets to make them go (they never want to on their own) and they end up peeing their pants! He usually does the bedtime routine and I still have to watch and make sure that he has them brush their teeth. Not only do I have to “watch” him watch our kids, I have to constantly be the bad guy making them follow the rules we set, and of course they act out because there is no consistency!

An example is that he and I agreed that the kids can have tablet time after dinner for an hour before bedtime-but they sit out in the living room with us and aren’t allowed to use their tablets in bed. I am usually working on Friday nights and my oldest asked me one night if I would let them watch their tablets in bed like daddy does…. There are so many little examples just like this that I can’t even write them all out.

I am the only one setting up their yearly doctor appointments, taking them in when they are sick, signing them up for school, scheduling conferences, helping them learn letters at home.  Our youngest has an IEP and I was alone through that entire process, getting the school to set it up, studying the laws so I could advocate better, fighting to the the IEP for them...he never once offered to help or look anything up on his own.  He was just ok letting me take care of it all. 

Lastly there is safety. He is not thorough at all. The best example I have is when he broke a kitchen glass. I was in bed, heard him drop the glass and clean it up and knew I would have to double check the area when I got up/before the kids went in the kitchen. He left for work and I went out to check and in the kitchen my oldest had a ride on toy car in the middle of the kitchen and I thought that was strange that he’s put it back after sweeping up glass…so I moved it and there were large shards of glass underneath it! He literally swept around this toy car to clean up the glass but didn’t think to get the glass underneath?! I am solely responsible for taking the children anywhere because I am terrified that he would be that parent who goes to drop their kid off and then forgets they are in the car and they die in the heat.

Nothing I mentioned here is a “well it only happened once” type thing. This is every single day. I have to think two steps ahead of everything he does to not only make sure our kids are ok, but make sure that we aren’t just living in filth. I am exhausted, and I have begged and begged for him to work on this. I am not seeing improvement. I am seeing a LOT of remorse, and sadness though.  There is so so much more I could go into, but I don't know if its worth it.

If he was a bad person I would have been gone yesterday. But he isn’t. He is a good man and I made a promise to him, and I am trying so hard to help him be more self sufficient not only for me and the kids but for himself. But I am wearing thin. I am managing everything and if I forget something, I have zero safety net there to help and support me. Anyone with ADD, please help me understand. Anyone married to someone with ADD, what are your thoughts? Everyone else, am I just kidding myself? I don’t want to give up hope, but I feel it slipping and I’m scared."
61,"I have been dating my boyfriend (22) for a year, and we just recently moved in together.

mentioned to me that he has been texting this girl from instagram who was interested in his music. He told me that there was nothing going on between them, and they were just talking about music and naturally I trusted his word. I’m not generally a jealous person because I believe that we have made it clear that our relationship is monogamous and I trust that he would respect that just as I have. But I noticed when I would bring her up as a joke, (I having this running gag that I always say “what’s her name? Is she hotter than me” whenever he is talking to a girl, like even his grandma) and he would be like dodgy about it. I felt he was hiding something so when he was sleeping I went through his phone. And I never, ever have gone through someone’s phone before, but I found out that he was texting this girl who lives across the country for like a month. Nothing ever physical happened they never met in person, but they send text messages, send nudes and call each other on the phone. They were essentially sexting while also having deep emotional conversations about life, music and her addiction.

When I confronted him about it he told me that he knew nothing was ever going to happen between them and that he loves me, but I still can’t get over the fact that he was sexting this girl, and saying things like ‘i miss you’ and ‘i wish you were here’ and all that shit.

Like I’m so upset, it makes me feel like I am not enough for him. Every time we fight I will always feel like he is going to turn to her for comfort. But I really don’t want to break up with him. He apologized to me, promised he would cut off all contact with her, and I believe him. And so far I've decided to stay with him. But I always am going to think about her.

Is this emotional cheating? Can I trust him again?

Should I stay with him/ how do I get over it?"
62,"A bit of background, I'm  (34,m) my group of friends kinda hovers from late 20s to 40s.  I consider some of my friends to be basically surrogate brothers, including the person in question.

We are all into the same assorted geeky interest. We have been there though valley's and peaks for one another school, shitty jobs, marriage, kids, careers even unexpected deaths.

I'm married I have a child and know the toll that takes on a person. My total identity isn't absorbed  and isn't defined by rearing a child or being a husband, it's a big part of me but not all of me.

Friend has been married for well over a decade to a woman who really isn't into his interest, and sees them more of a time sink or juvenile  interest. Her family is a group of realtor's and her main hobby apart from career advancement is keeping up with the Joneses and upgrading housing.

When was I freshly married they were trying to get me to get a mortgage. This was in 06-07 I was working a dead end job making THE minimum wage...I said no. The housing crisis happened they got stuck underwater with some real estate. They had too cut losses and downgrade into a starter.

Friend kinda starts fadeing more and more from everyone's life. We invite him to go see  movies.. always cancels last minute. We start playing magic the gathering with our cards we still have from the 90s.  We want to start around 6 PM. Friend says he can make it..he appears at 10:50PM can't leave house till kid's are asleep.

Friend really is into D&amp;D likes to listen to podcasts about it, knows I'm working on forming a regular game and ask to be apart of it. I politely tell him sure however since other people are involved I need to get a assured he can meet twice a month on a Friday or Saturday for three hours I get the assurance.

Next few weeks he is more animated than I see him in year's.  Calling me up and talking shop, invites me over to his place to roll some characters. His wife is with his sons watching a musical performance. Things are going well, we are having fun..his wife calls and his demeanor changes. 

He starts moving about the place quick spot cleaning. He never says it but you can tell from body language and tone I need to leave. I know his wife..why would my presence be a issue. The only way to describe it is..""I was the other woman""  and I needed to leave now that she was enroute.

This made me feel like shit, the weekend of game everyone is at my place and we wait...and wait. He goes on black out and won't answer text or phone calls. Everyone leaves, next day he calls and says he can't do Friday/ Saturday as that's when he spends time with his kids and wife. Says late Sunday 10pm is okay, school age person is in the group and that isn't going to work.

Friend hears me and buddies are playing all kinds of video games. He only has his cellphone and wife's laptop. Buddies and me band together and give him a 3DS and some games. He gives it back a few weeks later, says cellphone gaming is better for him as it's drop and go and work's better with kids.

Other friends counter's that you can do the same thing on a handheld. It's speculated his wife didn't approve.  I get a call from friend month or so later.."" want to hang out?""  Sure....I wait and wait and he calls me. I have to meet him at a 24 laundry mat it's midnight. He's washing their quilt's...we play WOW on the free Wi-Fi I had to provide both laptops. It felt...just sad.


He vanishes for long stretches of time.. the only time you can get ahold of him is the 15- minute drive from his work to daycare. Magically show's up for a mutual friends birthday. Buddy only wants me to have a few beers and geek out. Friend keeps turning the conversation too his career and kids. Buddy awkwardly  humor's then switched back , this switching went on for hour's.


He's confided in me that ""Almost all of his friends have left him""  I feel like he wants to talk about his interest or the good ol days, gets his nostalgia and has no plans on hanging out with me or anyone. I feel used ...I'm only around when it's convenient for himself.  I would be lying if I said it doesn't hurt, the guy is like a older brother to me.

Online I see post of ""in your 30s your priorities change, especially after kids"" well..no shit but how am I able to both and have a social life as well? I've been debating in my head I'm immature, Peter pan I never fully grew up he did ?  I've looked at myself critically perhaps I'm a asshole for feeling this way. Work and home take a lot of anyone. 

I haven't found a good answer online this subject isnt brought up a lot with men I've seen a few thread's with ladies in kinda similar situations. I've barred my soul..I'm prepared to take harsh constructive criticism. I apologise for spelling and grammar I'm writing this on phone in a moving car."
63,"I would like to preface this by stating that I’m fully aware of how stupid I sound throughout this post. But this is a situation I want to resolve especially because this man is my best friend. We’ve been through a lot, and I believe his current actions are just out of stupidity, and do not have malicious intentions. So please, do not tell me to break up with him. Advise me on how to handle/fix this situation. Thank you!

My significant other has been unfaithful twice throughout our three year relationship. The first time was right at the beginning of our relationship when I caught him sexting another woman. This woman was fully aware that my S/O was in a relationship. On top of that, when going through their messages I noticed she would quite often degrade me to him.

The second was about 8 months ago, two and a half years in. She found out I existed and approached me directly which I will be forever thankful for. At this point I chose to end the relationship. However within 2 months, we were back together due to his genuine willingness to fix his infidelity issues.  I feel this is vital to include because of its magnitude. He was/is doing everything he can to resolve this problem and make up (as much as he can) for every pain he’s caused. 

This week, I’ve caught him messaging the girl he sexted and cheated on me with the first time. The one who would degrade me.
The conversations (one at the beginning of the month and one this week) had been brief, and mostly related to their shared fan base. Absolutely nothing sexual.... yet (this is my worry).

How do I approach this situation?"
64,"My parents are generally reasonable people who have liked my previous girlfriends unless there is a good reason not to. They don't butt into my life, they only give their opinions when I ask.


I introduced my girlfriend Tracy on a family trip. In retrospect that was probably a bad idea and I shouldn't have had them spend several days together when they were just meeting for the first time.


One of the first things we did was go to an art exhibit. Tracy saw a portrait of a young girl and called the name ""Amy!"" sounding very shocked. She went over to the painting and told us it was a picture of her friend Amy, who had died as a child. Tracy looked at the name of the artist and said it was Amy's sister. Tracy didn't burst into tears or anything but she did tear up when she talked about Amy, and it was clear she was still affected by Amy's death. Tracy calmed down pretty quickly and I don't remember her mentioning Amy again during the trip.


I noticed later that my parents seemed cold towards Tracy. Not rude, and they weren't technically doing anything wrong, but Tracy asked me if they had a problem with her. I said they didn't but I eventually decided that something must be going on, because they are usually much friendlier. I asked my siblings and they thought Tracy was fine and didn't know anything about why our parents didn't like her.


I got my parents to admit what their problem was, and it turns out they were convinced that Tracy made the Amy story up and just pretended to get upset at some random painting to get attention. I knew that Tracy had been telling the truth, Tracy had mentioned to me awhile ago that her friend had died when they were young, and the next time we met Tracy's sister after the trip Tracy talked about seeing the painting and her sister responded as if she already knew about Amy. She teared up a little at both these other times when she discussed Amy, and I think it's genuine. Even without that additional info, I never would have assumed Tracy made this all up.


My parents did apologize to me, but I was pretty mad that any of this happened in the first place. I have no idea why they thought Tracy was lying, seeing the painting was a big coincidence but having a childhood friend die isn't that unlikely. My parents could have at least taken Tracy's word for it and only become suspicious if she was constantly telling outlandish stories.


I got really upset at my parents because even though they apologized, they didn't acknowledge how weird their assumption was and made it seem like they were sorry for being wrong, but that this was a reasonable assumption with the information they had. I didn't think this was reasonable at all and we got into an argument, with me asking ""are you dumb? What were you thinking??""


I'm not sure how to handle this now. My parents at least realized they were in the wrong and will treat Tracy better, but I don't know what else I need to do to make this right. Normally I would want to be honest with Tracy and tell her what happened, but I'm worried that knowing the truth might actually be more hurtful to her. It's clear that Amy is a sensitive subject. Ideally I would want my parents to apologize to Tracy but since they're convinced that their assumption was reasonable I don't know if that's going to happen. I'm not sure how to handle this, I've never actually had a problem like this before."
65,"My sister decided to divorce her soon to be ex husband about 3 months ago. He was emotionally abusive,  had anger issues, and was starting to get physical. She had kept all this from the family so we were surprised at first but are now trying to support her. He has moved out, but is not accepting the divorce all.  Gives everyone this sad story about how much he loves her and how hurt me is. Won't sign papers  and keep s begging her to give him another shot. Calls and text her when she asks him not to. Shows up at her house. I'm just not sure how to help her."
66,"I need help. I do not know what to do or who to talk to for advice as I dont know anyone that has been in a similar situation.

I(30F) have been with him(36M) for over 8 years. 

We both have our own businesses, we own a house and a dog together, have plans for the future.

But he just cant stop texting, flirting even going as far as meeting and kissing other girls.

He lies about everything... every time I find something out it is never what I think, or it is just not true.

He always makes me feel like I am the one with a problem, not trusting him, etc...

Last year was a burning point when I found out he went to a girls (25F) house, made out with her ( who knows maybe even more... ) I said I have had enough and I was done... but obviously decided to give him another change.

Come to find out he never stopped talking to her... when confronted he lies and said it is impossible and hasn't talked to her since the event.

I am tired of the lies, I dont feel like he actually really loves me even if he says he does. 

Apart from that our relationship is great.. we have hobbies we both like as well as each own own thing as well. Sex is great so I dont think that is the problem.

I feel like he is the kind of man that just needs attention alll the time... attention / being wanted / im not sure how to explain it.

I dont want to leave him... I just want the behavior to stop. 

Anyone who has been in a similar situation can tell me what they did ? I am so lost right now."

My boyfriend is really into fitness and has a nice body. We’ve been dating for about 6 years now and me working out has been brought up a few times. I’m not overweight or anything (5’4, 140lbs) just not fit. I’ve mentioned to him that I do want to start working out more and he knows I’ve been struggling with it. I haven’t found anything that’s really worked for me and I have a hard time being consistent with exercising - it also doesn’t help that I love beer. 

The other day we were talking and he basically said something along the lines of “looking good and working out is really important to me. I almost resent you because you won’t do this for me. I think you’re hot and I still want to bang you but hopefully when you get home we can start going to the gym” (we’re LD right now for a year). 

So basically that really hurt and made me feel like shit. I can’t stop thinking about his response. I know I want to lose weight too but I feel like there are so many other responses he could’ve given. Is he being a complete asshole? Am I overthinking everything? What do I say to that? What does “I still want to bang you” even mean???"
68,"I have been with this guy for two months. We get along really well, don't really fight, and have a great time together. He just called and said he wants to break up because his sister just ended things with her boyfriend, and he has been giving her advice. The gist of it is that she and him haven't figured out if they want to get married (they've been together 4 years). 

He's coming over to talk, but it's been two months. I don't expect him to be madly in love with me just yet. He said he expected to feel ""sure"" about getting married someday.

I don't know what to say or do when he gets here.

TL:DR: Boyfriend of two months wants to break up because he doesn't see himself marrying me."
69,"How do you know if they’re the one?  What if you’re going to sacrifice something you love (career, traveling, family) and found out it was not worth it in the end? How do you know what to choose and not regret it? I have hard decision to make. Either do what i love or be with who i love."
70,"How do i move on? I feel like everything has just collapsed and the world i thought i had didnt exist. Theres too many details and after finding out the truth by looking through her phone finally, i realized she has been cheating on me and manipulated me for 3.5 of the 4.5 years we have been married... and we aren't fully separated yet and im seeing from single friends she is already on tinder behind my back still, while to my face still keeps up this teary eyed crying saying i love and care about you bullshit to my face. I just dont know where to go or what to do. I see mental health people but nothing has been helping im getting so anxious and worked up every time we have to interact for legal reasons. 

Also i see people apologizing for post formats and stuff but i just use reddit to follow gaming stuff mostly. So sorry for the format? but im at an all time low with everything in my life."
71,"So yeah, first ever post here, maybe I'll regret it I don't know.

Some backstory, this was a long distance relationship. We met online a few years back, started sexting, started getting more intimate and sweet with each other. I flew across the country twice to visit them, the first visit was amazing. Everything we both ever wanted, so my ex asked me to come back as soon as possible and obviously I did etc etc, but on the second visit they broke up with me.

Fast forward a few months, we're still best friends. We had a few months where we just put up some boundaries.....and then those broke down pretty quickly, they said it was just FWB and I was able to convince myself for the longest time I only loved them as a friend now and that I was okay with being best friends and friends with benefits.

And now at the present, we're still best friends and we still spend as much time together as possible but they started dating someone. Which I was okay with at first, we were still sexting and such etc etc because I was until very recently still convinced I didn't love them more than as my best friend. And then the other morning I woke up, told them I just couldn't do it anymore. I didn't tell them I loved them still, I just told them I didn't want to cause any problems with us still sexting and so I ended it. I told them we're still best friends, and that nothing changes between us besides no more sexual stuff, I just wanted them to focus on their new date and I really do want them to focus on that new person, I wasn't just saying that to make them happy.

I guess what I'm asking is for advice on how to proceed from here. I still love them so much, so much so that I don't feel okay with jumping into dating again myself, and I just want them to be happy, and I want them to feel like their new date and hang out with us but it's so difficult. Should I just suck it up and deal with it? Should I try to spend less time with them? It doesn't help that recently they told me they even though they think this date could go somewhere, they aren't sure what they want romantically."
72,"How do I handle this without making things super weird? What does this spell for my relationship? How can I make sure that the two still remain friends? Lastly, does this sort of thing happen, and what outcome is to be expected?"
73,"A good friend and housemate of mine recently broke up with his gf. I dont know why and I dont see it as my business, so when he told me what had happened I just hugged him and said he can talk to me about it whenever he needs to. We also hung out with our other housemate who he also told and had drinks/joked around till late.

Now my friend has a history of anxiety/depression and I believe so did his X, so my friends and I have been looking out for him, cooking, playing video games etc and making sure he knows we're there for him. I didnt really know his X besides meeting her a few times but earlier today I got a message asking me to check up on him and that she just wants to know he's okay.

I saw the message pop up so she doesnt know ive read it yet, but im not entirely sure what to do. Obviously I dont want her to worry, but I dont want to get in the middle of this as it has nothing to do with me. I feel like I should tell my friend as well as it feels weird keeping something from him about his X so soon after their breakup.

I just dont know whats best and I dont want to create more problems for them by jumping the gun."
74,I broke up with my ex a few months ago and have started a new relationship. I heard from my ex twice this week - both by text - first asking if I still play the Friends game and are we friends? I never replied. Then today he told me he knows I don't want to keep in touch but since we were together for 7 years he wanted me to know that his granddaughter broke her leg bad (she's only 2) and is in a body cast for 6 weeks.  I feel bad but don't want to play into this if it's a ploy? I was just going to say I'm sorry to hear that and hope she gets well soon.  Suggestions?
75,"Hi everyone!


So my coworker started working at my job about 6 months ago. I thought he was flirting with me at first and developed a crush on him, but a few weeks later he mentions having a new girlfriend. We end up becoming best friends and although my crush never fully went away, I had accepted the fact that nothing was gonna happen between us romantically and I really valued our friendship. 


So fast forward about six months, he is quitting his job and moving in with his gf. It seems like she wants to get married to get her citizenship, but I kept my mouth shut when he said that. Anyways, he asks me to go for dinner/ drinks with him when he gave his two weeks’ notice, so we go. As he gets drunk, he basically professes his feelings for me and said that things would have been different between us if he didn’t have a girlfriend. He then says that he doesn’t want me to be with anybody else, and when I go to drop him home he begs me to stay for a while, and the entire time he was cuddling me and trying to kiss me. I didn’t let him kiss me obviously and left soon after, and the next day at work he says he doesn’t really remember the last ~20min of the night (when he was trying to kiss me) but was apologizing profusely.
I feel so confused right now because my emotions are coming back, but it seems to me like he’s trying to forget about this and will still move in with his gf. I don’t think that’s fair to her but I also don’t want to ruin a relationship. We had a short conversation about this where he apologized again and we agreed to forget this happened, but should I bring this up again? I didn’t tell him how he was behaving once we got to his place because I didn’t want to make him feel worse, but now I feel that I probably should have. He’s been acting semi normally with me at work and will be leaving soon, so I’m not sure if it’s worth the drama. 


Any advice would be much appreciated!

Tl;dr coworker professes his feelings for me when drunk, days before moving in with gf. Do I confront him about this?"
76,"So for background info, my parents split when I was 5. This resulted in me living with my mom and seeing my maternal grandparents constantly as a kid, while my dad and paternal grandparents lived in a different province. My paternal grandparents would only see me once or twice a year, and even as a kid I felt like they didn’t adjust their behaviour to my age. But now it’s just ridiculous.

Starting in my mid-teens, I became increasingly annoyed with how my paternal grandfather treats me. He still calls me sweetie and honey, and he constantly questions my decisions. Not even life decisions, but small ones that barely even matter. Things like wearing a hoodie instead of a real jacket when he finds it cold (I grew up in a very cold province, he lives in a milder one). The worst is in a restaurant. If I order water/a smaller main/a salad instead of fries, he will almost invariably say, “are ya suuuure, sweetie?”. It boils my blood, and I’ve told him how mad it makes me. 

I’m not a confrontational person, but this past spring, I had a slight public freak out about it. I was just off the plane to visit them, I was tired and annoyed from the flight and we went to Subway. When they asked if I wanted a combo, I said no, and he said “are ya suuuure, sweetie?” I snapped at him that yes, I’m sure, and don’t ever ask me that again. The Subway woman was looking at me like I was a total bitch, and I was so embarrassed. The thing is, I moved to a dorm in a different city when I was 18. I got my own apartment at 19. I’m almost done my Bachelors, and between scholarships and a couple office jobs, I’ve paid most of my tuition (my family did help too, and I’m grateful, just making the point that I wasn’t completely reliant on them). I never ask my family for money; although I do get some cash for bdays/Christmas and my maternal grandparents like to give me $100 every few months or so, I do not expect/budget for this money (although again, I appreciate it!). So him acting like this just makes me feel like all my hard work is invalidated. 

My paternal grandparents are coming to visit me soon, and I don’t want to just flip out about this. But I feel sure that he’s going to do it, and sure that I’m going to get mad. What should I do to prevent this from happening?

TLDR: Grandfather second-guesses my decisions, it makes me mental but I don’t want to blow up in public, what should I do?"
77,"Hi,This is my first post here.
I don't know or maybe have any place where I could just ask unbiased opinion that's why asking help .Im kinda feeling helpless and really weak.

Tl;dr :
Me(22f) and my boyfriend(22) were in a relationship for 6 months and we were good friends for an year prior to that.


We really clicked when we started talking , really compatible ,used to finish each other sentences.

After some time 5 months.. he started acting distant and cold to me ,when I asked he said that he just doesn't feel like talking to anyone and feel clingy if someone ask about this from him.He needed some time and space alone.

Its been 2 months since that and things hasn't changed.He started out a new job,i understand things get hectic but whenever we meet i feel he is cold to me and not warm as before.

He told me we should break up because he feel like he is hurting me by this and he doesn't want to waste my time.

I told him repeatedly over and over ,how precious he is to me.That this might just be a phase and we can fight this together.
that it is really lucky we have got love and we should handle this relationship with value.

He said that he understands me but he just doesn't feel like talking to me or to anyone.
He said its not the fact that he is busy,he just doesn't want to give time even if he has.

I just feel tired and really heartbroken.I still feel ,i hope if I can stay here we can make this work. Even though he doesn't agree.He doesn't have problem in being friends but he just doesn't wanna be with anyone.

I feel a decision has been taken for me and this feels unfair and I have to do what?

Should I kill my feelings for him? I really love him.

Can you guys advise me or help a sad person out?"
78,"I had extremely messed up teeth as a kid. Like, insanely messed up. I had a massive overbite that my orthodontist gave me two options to correct: I could lose multiple molars on both sides of my top jaw to even out the imbalance, or I could have my jaw surgically broken and wired shut to correct it. My mom chose the latter. It was a bit of a traumatic experience only being able to eat liquid food and drink through a straw for awhile, and being physically unable to really open my mouth. It was painful too.

After that I had braces and a herbst (?) appliance which is two metal rods on either side of the mouth connected to caps over molars that prevents the jaw from closing in its natural position and forces it to move. I had that appliance for a year and braces for 3 years. 

I have a very small mouth. My teeth did not have any space, and were basically overlapping everywhere. My front teeth stuck out like crazy, to the point where my lips are messed up from it. When I smile my lip folds dramatically on one side, as it had used to do so to compensate for teeth that stuck out far worse than the rest and avoid being sawed off by them. It basically looks like I have no top lip on one side when I smile even now because it just naturally curls/folds under. Generally beyond that my lips pull back too far when I smile openly because of how much my teeth used to stick out. 

My gums are screwed too. They’re thin and weak from how much strain they were under to hold my overcrowded teeth in, and also from the stress of having my teeth move with the braces. My gums have thinned dramatically since I got my teeth fixed; it literally looks like my teeth have gotten bigger but it’s my gum tissue receding. I had to have a gum graft a couple years ago (they cut a chunk off the roof of my mouth, sliced up the tissue in front of my two front bottom teeth, and then sewed the chunk on to replace the tissue which was thinning far worse than the rest) and the tissue takes a long long time to come to match the rest due to the difference in blood vessels in the different places. So it looks like I have this weird patch of extremely pale gum tissue in front of my bottom teeth. 

My gums are just generally kinda bad. I’ll probably have issues with it in the future and require more grafts, or veneers/dentures in the more distant future. 

Basically... my teeth and my smile have always been a huge insecurity of mine. I absolutely despised the way I looked when my teeth were bad and when I had braces. I thought I’d feel better when my teeth were fixed, but it’s honestly just brought about a host of new insecurities. Like the receding gums and the appearance of the gum graft. 

I still don’t really like the way I look when I smile with my teeth showing. I hate the weird way my lip curls under on one side. I hate the way my lips pull back too far and it looks like I’m straining to smile as hard as I possibly can, even though I’m not. I really just don’t like it. It takes a very conscious effort from me to smile with my teeth showing in a way that I think looks better, but usually just ends up as me looking like I’m dead inside because I’m focusing so much and you can see in my eyes that I’m thinking way too hard and would rather be doing anything else. 

Because of this I smile with my mouth closed. I prefer it. I think I look better. I think it makes a big difference in pictures of me, because that smile is much more natural to me and I feel like I’m pretty that way so I don’t look like I’m straining or forcing it when I look at the pictures.  I feel like I look my best that way. 

I’ve dealt with the comments over it for years. From family members, from photographers on picture days and weddings and such. “Come on, give us a real smile! Show those beautiful teeth! Smile!” “Smile with your teeth, we paid a lot for those teeth!” “Smile for real! You look angry/sad!” “You could at least try to smile like you mean it!”

It’s unnerving. I feel GOOD that way. I don’t want to smile in a way that I don’t feel looks good. 

My boyfriend has made a few comments about it. Somehow this bothers me far worse than anyone else saying anything. He’s said things like, “Why do you always smile so weird in pictures? You look uncomfortable.” “I wish you’d smile for real in pictures.” “You have such a beautiful smile, why don’t you smile in pictures?” 

Obviously I do smile with my mouth open in day to day life. When I’m laughing. When I’m happy and giving a natural reaction, I’ll smile with my mouth open. I just really really hate to see it captured in a picture. It’s never genuine in pictures. The smile I give when I laugh, or when I’m happy/excited, that’s genuine... but trying to force that for a picture? It never is. 

I really don’t know how to get across to him, to everyone really, that I HATE how I look when I smile the way they expect. I don’t look my best. I don’t feel my best. My smile is my smile and I’ll do it the way I feel is best. How do I tell them to piss off with their unnecessary comments? Am I being dramatic for finding this so hurtful? 

TLDR; my smile has always been a huge insecurity of mine. I hate the way my teeth look. I smile with my mouth closed and everyone gives me shit for it."
79,"I've been dating more than I ever have this semester. I've been a hook up guy over the past few years and I've gotten so sick of it. I'm craving emotional connection. At the beginning of the semester I downloaded a few dating apps and tried my luck. Initially I was worried getting dates would be my main problem. Thankfully it's not difficult to find people to go on dates on, but the main problem is finding people you want to go on a second date with. 


Almost all of my dates have been ""fine"". The date itself is at least enjoyable, but I don't want to continue going on dates with said person. For some reason or another I'll just not feel the connection I need to feel. Since the semester has started there have only been two people that I wanted going on dates with. The first person [F22] I actually went out with for a few weeks. The first date we went on was probably the best date I've ever been on. It didn't neccesarily make me hopeful for the future of the relationship, but the date itself was really fun. We had sex. I knew we'd have sex. It was clear when we were texting it was what she wanted. It wasn't my goal, but I wasn't going to turn it down either. The sex was really good, but it was purely physical. From that point on I felt like I couldn't get emotionally invested in any of the sex we had (if that makes any sense). It always stayed physical for me and that got boring. Spending time with her non sexually was fun and wholesome, but I was never able to get too attached. I ended things when I realized my feelings would never change.


The second girl [F21] I wanted a second date with was really cool initially. The first date was great. Fairly wholesome, but there were some red flags that I ignored. Things ended up getting really complex and the situation turned into a shitshow so I distanced myself. I started getting the feeling that I wasn't going to find anyone this semester and just invited a female friend visiting to an upcoming date night my frat is having. I've been on more dates, but I haven't wanted to pursue any of them until recently.


A girl [F19] on one of the dating apps liked my profile. I didn't expect much when I saw the notification, but I opened up the app to see if I wanted to match with her. She immediately took my breath away (I know how cringy that sounds, but I'm being serious). I overall just loved her profile, moreso then anyone I've matched with. We started chatting and I genuinely enjoyed getting to know her. I already developed a small crush on her before we even met. We made plans for yesterday to get dinner. 


Before we met I was extremely nervous. I hadn't felt this way about a date since early highschool. I'm usually so confident when it comes to dating, but the idea of her made me nervous (in a good way?). I had been pushing off getting a haircut for a while, but the date pushed me to finally do it. I made sure I was well groomed and my clothes were top tier. I have no idea why I was so excited about her based off of so little, but that's how I felt.


When we finally met she was way more beautiful than I expected. Her smile is incredibly adorable and her eye contact made me melt. She's just so bright. Personality wise she wasn't what I expected. Turns out she's an awkward fuck in the most wholesome way possible. She didn't care either. I guess she was confidently awkward if that makes any sense. Chatting with her was way better than I expected. She's so cool and smart. Dinner was a blast. She's just such a wholesome and sweet girl and I can't get enough. I know how weird I sound, but I promise I didn't let it show. I'm pretty good at acting normal in person. Well it seemed like she was having as good of a time I was. She told me she was really happy that we got dinner together and we started making plans to get together again. When she got home she texted me that she had a good time and we planned the next date for next week.


I'm so fucking happy. I'm so excited to see her again. I know that I'm probably going to get burned, but I'm going to enjoy this as long as it lasts. If it doesn't work out I'm going to be really bummed, but it happens. I'll probably find someone else, right? That being said I don't really have any desire to continue talking to the girls I've been in contact with anymore. I can't force myself to message back any of them. Again, I know I'm getting too invested too quickly, but I can't really control feeling this way. Going back to this girl, it seems like she has no intention to hooking up quickly which is so nice and refreshing. I don't see any red flags either. I really wanted to share how I was feeling so if anyone reads this thank you. 


In regards to advice, what do you think we should do for the next date? Watching a movie was thrown around. I like the idea of spending time together in a private place. I find it to be much more relaxed and easier to get to know someone in private. We were also seriously talking about taking scuba lessons together, but that definitely needs more planning. Definitely not a second date thing haha."
80,"Wife said she's ok with it, but now I'm getting nervous that maybe I shouldn't go. We also have a 2 year old at home. Am I in the wrong if I go to an event with a friend at a time like this?

Edit: it should be noted she's pregnant with twins

Edit 2: many have expressed concern over the classic movie-esque trope of a woman saying she's ok with something when in reality she isn't and it blows up later. After being with my wife for 12 years, she's never once pulled that move, so I don't expect that to happen, but I do understand the concern."
81,"I have no idea if this is the right place to post this, but here we go. So i recently got out of a long relationship, for reasons i won't go into here, but it's all still very fresh in my mind. Shortly after that, i met a girl at my university, she seemed cool, she asked me to hang out, we did, and she tried to kiss me. Immediately i told her i'm really not ready for a relationship, and i'm not into FWB types of arrangements, and told her that we could be friends if she wanted to. She asked if i knew whether i'd be ready for a relationship sometime soon, and i said that i didn't know and i can't promise her anything. Alright, she agreed we would just be friends if that's cool with me, which it was. We texted a bit in the next couple of days, i noticed she was a bit flirty with me but didn't pay much attention to it. So this morning, she calls me and says she's in front of my apartment and i invited her up to have a coffee. Cool, we drank coffee, we talked, but then at one point she started getting handsy and started kissing me on the cheek, trying to kiss my neck, so i knew what was going on and told her to please stop. She didn't stop. Instead she put her hand on my junk, i removed her hand, she put it there again and started talking about all sorts of things she wanted me to do to her...sounds like a dream now that i'm typing it out, but it was very real an hour ago. I kept rejecting her, and she was constantly talking how she can see that i want it, there's no shame in it, that type of stuff. I just didn't want to do it, told her no and removed her hand one more time. At that point she got angry and left, and afterwards i blocked her on instagram and deleted her number. I'm expecting a call any second now. What the hell did i do wrong, and what should i do now?"
82,"As you can tell from the time apart and age gap I was young and dumb.  We started dating when I was 17 and I didn't know any better . He cheated on me shortly after I moved in with him at 18 and I had incredibly awful trust issues moving forward. I wanted to try and make it work because I was naive and thought I could but for the entire year and a half we lived together it was a constant issue. It was an emotional rollercoaster. The highs were so high. He could make me feel like a queen and then he would make me feel like complete garbage the very next day. He would delete messages on his phone, watch porn at work and then gaslight me. He blamed me in many arguments for being the reason he couldn't see his son. For a short time he made me believe I had a mental illness so I went to therapy and realized I was being emotionally/mentally abused. I was so finanically dependent on him that I could not leave. I was 19 and worked in a fast food restaurant. I started seeing other people, even though we lived together. I take the blame and responsibility for that because I knew exactly what I was doing. He senses that, and tries to pull me closer into his web. I am not entirely innocent on this end as I did end up returning the manipulative behavior. My mom bought me a plane ticket and I moved back in with her after constant daily panic attacks. After we broke up the emotional impact on me kept me stunted and I didn't know how to have a healthy relationship. I still kept in contact with him while living with my mom for a few months till he realized I was seeing someone else. Even then i still felt the need to know what was going on in his life. When i found out he was dating someone else i was frustrated because i didnt know then what i know now.  They seemed happy and he seemed like the man he could never be for me , but I realize that was a front. The same front I put on when he was with me . I didnt know that at the time so I lashed out and messaged her  telling her about everything that happened. She denied it but asked me ""how I got over his porn addiction."" 
 I met another man (my own age) and weve been happily together for 5 years. He made me realize that I am capable of being loved, and we have a very healthy relationship where we value open communication and trust eachother completely, even after I never thought I could trust anyone again. 

My ex recently messaged me in Facebook (a new facebook account mind you. He went our of his way to find me) to apologize to me.  
It was simple 
""I'm sorry for all the hurt I caused you and I am grateful for all of the lovely time we spent together"" 
I told my bf and he told me to delete and ignore it because it was just a cry for attention. 

Tl;dr my manipulative ex , who is now married has contacted me with an apology after years. 

I have not responded and just deleted the message but I can't help but feel frustrated. Why is he attempting to come back into my life after all this time of no contact. Is this just a manipulative ploy to pull me back into his circle.  Why can't I just live my life? What the hell does he want from me? Why do I feel the need to try and understand why. I feel like I have to know. Is it unhealthy for me to keep focusing on this. How do I overcome it."
83,"I’ll visit my friend on Jan. And we haven’t see each other for 4 years. It’s been such a long time.
We do text each other but not that often. But he mentioned that he’s also looking forward to see me.

So I thought I can write him letters from now on until Jan. For a gift for him.
Just write things that I’m excited to see you/ about my life and stuffs.

I got plenty of times (3 months), so I  might write lots of letters.
Gonna give whole letters to him when we meet.

So is this too much? Or not?
Do you guys like receiving/writing letters to your friends?

Maybe this is a silly question but I just want to know how many people still write letters."
84,"     This is my first Reddit post and probably will be my only Reddit post, I am much more of a browser than a content creator.

     That being said, my boyfriend and I are, to my knowledge, very happy and compatible on all fronts. He seemed like the perfect guy for me and he’s met my family and they adore him. They are very hopeful for our relationship and quite happy that I’ve found a great guy after a string of some not-so-hot boyfriends. This being said, this past weekend he dropped quite a bombshell on me! He had expressed that he had previously used some substances other than the typical cigarettes, weed, or alcohol. 

     I accepted this as the past and he assured me he wasn’t looking to be that person anymore; it was behind him. I am a straightedge girl, so I haven’t done anything and I’m really against anything that’s is more than weed... even that’s kinda tricky for me. I know it can be unreasonable to hold others to the standard in which I hold myself, however, I have been trying to be patient. I understand that it’s a lifestyle change and it will take time, however, I’m afraid he won’t ever transition away from it. His friends don’t seem to help, he is seen as the milder one! 

     I don’t want to isolate him because I understand the value of having friends, but the quality of friends seems to drag him down. He is easily influenced by bad behavior and he seems to immediately regret using these days, but it is something that makes me quite anxious! It is something that would be a deal-breaker with anyone else, however, he is really perfect in every other way. I feel like if he is able to move past this one issue I’d be happy with this guy for a very long time, but I don’t really know what to do or what I should think about this whole situation. If I could get some genuine interpretations and guidance I’d really appreciate it!  

Thank you!"
85,"I can't assure what I know is accurate, since the recounts that I've heard are from each parent and what I overhear from their shouting matches.

My dad works six days a week, with a few holidays through the year from 3 am to about 4 pm. Following the death of his father, he became depressed, and had a large enough arguement with his family that following the funeral, everyone on my paternal side of the family had changed their numbers and moved without disclosing where to. This worsens his depression, and from what I can tell he's sleeping one to no hours every night.

My mum comes from a background that doesn't believe in anything mental illness related, like depression or self-esteem and the like. My dad's gone and gotten a diagnosis, which has diagnosed him with anxiety and depression. From what he's told me, she's dismissed it as what I can only describe as a 'made up condition to make money off of', and believes that he's only doing it for the attention.

Right now they're not speaking to each other, following a two day shouting match where they seemed to have decided on divorce- splitting up the family, selling the house and renting in different areas, while their children could go and be independent if they so wished to.

Of course all of this only serves to worsen his condition, and he's found solace in me. He's told me about his plans to move to an area over an hours drive away, telling me it was because there's better paying jobs in that area. He'd also been trying to push for a trip down to the same area, which I've been deflecting using the excuse of Uni.

Just yesterday and today, and also the reason for me writing this post, he's been pushing me to open a bank account in my name so he'd be able to deposit money into it, to 'save up for events' like a wedding for one of my cousins on his side of the family. Seeing as how we'd been cut off from that side of the family, I'm a bit skeptical about opening this account, and have also been trying to deflect this request with Uni work. I'd given up on outright denying him given his current volatility.



I don't see any way how this situation can improve, and have been considering moving out and renting with a friend so that I still live near Uni and everything I'm familiar with. What can I do in this situation?"
86,"My girlfriend moved in with two of her friends a couple in their early 20s and they broke up. Since they broke up one is moving out which mean her rent is going to go up. She doesn't want a 2nd job  which is understandable, so she asked if I wanted to rent the couch for a few hundred a month. We have been dating for maybe 3.5 months but have known each other for a year. I wouldnt be living in her room I'd have the couch, which means my own space which is a necessity for me. Her roommate and I get along really well. I wouldn't be on the lease so if I need to I could leave without too many negatives. I'm currently living at home with my mother. We live pretty far away from work and it makes it annoying but if I move in with my girlfriend I'd be on the free bus route and I'd be closer to work. This would be my first time living out of my mothers house. Should I move in with her?

TL;DR girlfriend of 3.5 months rent is going up. She asked me to move in and take the couch for a few hundred a month. Theres tons of pros and cons. This would be the first time living outside of my moms house. Do I do it?"
87,"So me and my GF have reached a tipping point with a particular problem and it's resulting in some vicious arguments which don't go anywhere because they get so heated. I won't pitch the problem here because I think we can resolve it if we can figure out how to communicate effectively around this subject without loosing our cool. There is a lot of resentment on both sides so things explode pretty quickly and there is no progress as a result because we both become so defensive and angry.  


I'd like to hear what has worked for other people in terms of conflict resolution strategies. I've been thinking about a structured conversation where we both take turns in acknowledging each other's feelings, apologising, not blaming each other, empathising as much as possible etc. but maybe there are other techniques available?

Thanks in advance"
88,"Hey guys... so basically I got into an incident where my brother has to track my phone ( I’m dating a Hispanic boy and my parents are extremely conservative Arabs and hate that) so basically I have to turn my location services on for my brother.... I need to see my boyfriend at least 1 time a week... so how would I disable the service or “ freeze” it for like 5 hours... I was thinking of getting a new phone and logging into my iCloud on that phone but turning the location off for that phone ...: I work at a hospital and I would go drop off my phone and my car at the hospital to seem as if I was there but in reality my boyfriend would pick me up... and take me out... id still have the other phone...  would this work??? 

please help.."
89,"So I (male) made a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m someone who dated a person (female) of a different culture for about 3 years. Everything was great- we were in love, I knew I wanted to marry this person, I thought they were truly the one. I even was starting to shop for a ring. 

Problem is that her parents did not approve of our cultural differences. I tried to do everything to keep them satisfied- convert, learn the culture, etc. However in the end we broke up because my ex decided they were tired of being pulled in 2 directions even though we truly thought we were meant to be together. 

As bad as it sounds after some time we talked and my ex said they wished the best for me and thought our breakup was honestly for the best. It’s been rough for me since I was obviously so in love with this person. We have not talked and cut all ties if social media besides one that we both have- reddit. 

So the other day I came across a reddit post with a comment from the account of my ex. It was an askreddit post and came across the comment without lurking on their account. And what I did was probably wrong. So since they know my personal account I made another one and commented back. Their comment was about an awkward first date they were discussing and I was wondering if it was recent. I asked something like “how did it go are you guys still together” and I got an answer “were still 6 months strong” or something of the sort. The problem with all this is that about 5 of those months cross with our relationship. 

With all this being said here comes my question- do I confront my ex about this? I really want some closure and the truth. If so, should I text my ex and come out directly about the comments or bring it up casually something like “did you leave me for your family or someone else or another reason?” 

I know it sounds childish but I honestly want answers and closure. Thanks for any helpful advice.

TL;DR: Male dated female for 3 years. Broke up due to cultural differences. Recently found out ex might have cheated. Should I confront her?"
90,"I (M 20) don’t want to divulge every detail here because firstly it’s painful and also I don’t let want to bore you as it is a very lying story. 

Suffice it to say I’ve been in a relationship with the most amazing girl ( F 18) for 3 years now and she has been the most wonderful person and we have had a solid relationship that was the envy of our friends. However, this summer things changed. She began to start exploring her sexuality around April this year, which I encouraged because I consider myself to be a very liberal minded person. 

After I finished my A levels in June I held a gathering and she invited a plus one ( which I was cool with) this girl ( F 24)  turns up and looks very nice and is very friendly, my girlfriend says she didn’t know but this girl ends up being bisexual and they engaged in some sexual activity in my room, that evening and she ended up staying in my bed. Throughout the whole summer my girlfriend has constantly been on the phone to this girl and had intercourses with her a few times, we also had a threesome with her in September which I massively regret. Finally I lost my rag with it in and said if she loves me and is committed to me she needs to stop having sex with this girl and give me more attention, she agreed. 

However the attention my gf gave me became even more minimal, I finally pulled her up on it and threatened to leave her, she got very tearful said she loved me and apologised, however it still seemed to continue, finally two weeks ago  I found out that she had still been shagging this girl and had thus been cheating on me. I was fucking ( mind my language) distraught and smashed a chair, I never thought she would do this to me. Again she was very upset said she was glad I had seen messages about her cheating and said she loved me. However that night she saw the girl again, they probably shagged to I assume. 

Then last week it got a bit messy, I was out with my gf, the girl messaged and said she was pregnant ( she was lying) my girlfriend rushed over and it all got a bit messy. She ended up breaking up with her and came back to me and we had a great week with great times out and lots of great sex. However I have now found messages again and my girlfriend had asked to be her gf again on fb messenger, she says she is seeing a friend tonight but she is really seeing this girl to shag. I really don’t know what to do, I love my girlfriend to bits, she is my world and the thought of losing her crushes me. It has also majorly affected my University attendance ( I started in September). 

During the time of my gf has been seeing this girl, my girlfriend has lost her job and this girl ,she says she loves, has got her hooked on coke, my gf was hospitalised over an MDMA overdose a month ago and nearly died because this girl has coerce her into taking drugs and she’s a Lying cheat. 

Please tell me what I should do and what should I do tonight, my family know but her family only partially know as she would get thrown out over the drug abuse.

Oh and sorry I should probably add she came to the conclusion that she ( my Gf ) is bisexual."
91,"In our relationship we were always together if you saw one of us you saw both of us. We fought and had broken up a few times. One thing I should mention is my gf has been suicidal in the past and doesn’t seem to be all there. I’ve been trying to get her help but she always refused. So I don’t think her head is on straight. But I’ll get back to that

The past two weeks she asked me for space she said she was at school just studying by herself. So this past Tuesday I go to the school to surprise her and she’s there with another girl and some guy right behind her. A guy I knew and told her I don’t trust this guy. When I saw her I said what the fuck is this and the guy just acted like he was doing nothing wrong. So we walked outside and I asked her did you cheat on me and she said “ya I did” and I told her how and she said “he kissed me”. So I walked away.

The next day I get some voicemails from her (she was blocked) and tells me she wants to explain and tell me what happened. She first asked have you noticed there’s been something wrong with me? She said she thinks about killing herself all the time, she now has an eating disorder, and she doesn’t feel right in the head anymore. I asked her what happened and she said they had been hanging out and she told him that “it was nice not being alone” although she asked me for space and hardly texted me while she was at school. She then told me “I did like him because he didn’t know how fucked up I am in the head” she said she told her parents everything which Is really hard to do. And she’s now seeing a therapist. She said it was a peck when he walked her to her car and that was as far as it got. He kept calling her so I called him and he said “omg she said you guys weren’t together” “she never said you guys were dating again” so I hung up and she said “I did tell him he’s only saying that to break us up I pinky promise and starts hyperventilating”

I have noticed the mental issues she’s been going through. I also suffer from anxiety and depression. So I’m glad to see she’s finally going to be getting help today. 

I’m so anxious and nervous and on edge all the time now though.  I know it just happened but she did apologize and maybe the mental issues did cause her to cheat.

She did say she was willing to do anything to work it out with me. I’m not sure what to think or do or anything.

Even the day after she kissed him she told my roommates sister while they were at school that she couldn’t wait to marry me.

I want to salvage this. I want to be with her I just don’t know where to start"
92,"We have been married for a year, together for 3. I found condoms in his truck on pure chance, unopened but a 3 pack ""for her pleasure"". He says they were from a long time ago, but while we were dating. The box was in fresh condition. I checked the expiration date, research online about how long they are typically good for, did the math and before I left for work I told him he had to have bought the condoms in 2019, while we were married. 

We have both been cheated on in past relationships, so whenever our insecurities pop up and I ask ""you would never cheat on me right?"" He responds with something like, ""I would never want to make you go thru that pain. I love you. That's why we are married. Do you see how bad with women I am? I only hang out with you."" So up until sunday evening, I felt like that was the one thing I knew he would never do, I felt so confident and so strongly about that one thing. 

Come back home to an attempt from him to make things better. A favorite dinner we like to share together, along with some truths, which killed my appetite in seconds. He confessed he bought the condoms a couple weeks ago and he had considered sleeping with someone else. So much so to go get condoms. For her pleasure. He wanted to make another woman feel good, while we havnt had sex in about 4 months. Which includes typical days to have sex on, like my birthday and our wedding anniversary. He deleted their conversation and blocked her. He deleted conversations they had while he was sitting next to me on the couch. While he laid next to me in our bed. I noticed when he would show me a picture or something, that he would quickly take back his phone, and he admitted that he didnt want me to see her name pop up.

I told him to get out. I got her name and some background info. I believe he told me her name in confidence that I wouldn't find her. She didnt have popular social media accounts, but I found her professional one that matched details he gave me. He was expecting me to be angry and sad. He expected me to say mean things to him and lash out with the intent to hurt him. ""I'm going to let you express your feelings because you are entitled to feel that way."" Type of responses from him, which pissed me off even more. I wanted his suffering, his anguish, I wanted him to hurt. 

I told him I was going to message her. He started to freak out, spill out his anguish and turmoil and how much he was suffering. Asked me not to, how it wouldn't fix or help anything, how it was between me and him. Since the girl knew he was married, I explained that she played the game. Also, we wouldnt be doing this if he also did not message her. I never wanted him to message anyone that involved intimate attention that is suppose to be devoted to his wife, in the monogamous relationship we are in. 

I messaged her. She denied everything and even threw in a couple lines like ""I would never remotely involve myself with a married man. You have the wrong person. I'm sorry you're going thru this."" I confirmed her picture to him and he said it was her, followed up with a message not outwardly accusing her, but letting her know that the truth is out and I know. She took down her picture.

We both expressed we want our marriage to work and last til death separates us. We agreed to go to a marriage counselor. I decided to forgive him now and stop playing off a power, bullying dynamic for the sake of our mental health, for the sake of our jobs. It is incredibly exhausting to be so sad, so hurt and so full of hateful rage continuously.

Things I find myself thinking about... did he say good morning and good night everyday? How many pictures were sent and received? How many time did he tell her how pretty, hot or sexy she was? If I never found the condoms, would this still be going on? How special did they make each other feel? Do I deserve this? I deserve this. Am I not intellectually stimulating enough? How many times while I was away at work would he be home and masterbating to her? How many times did he miss my phone call cos his phone was on silent because he didnt want me to get suspicious on how much his phone is going off? How long was this actually happening? How many times did he say how hard he was for her? How much information did he share about me to her in a negative light? How many times did he say how he wishes he could be with her right now? How much he missed her? Why does this hurt so much? Why do I have to pretend to be ok? Why do I have to be mature? Why am I trying to spin this to make it easier for him? Why do I cry so hard then suddenly stop and feel empty? I hate myself. I hate him. I hate myself for letting myself be vulnerable to him. I hate myself for changing my thoughts for someone who I feel very strongly for. I hate that I believed him and felt so foolishly confident that he would never ever make me feel this way. If I actually read their conversations... what decisions would I be making today? Am I letting him off too easy? Am I protecting his feelings by holding back what I am thinking and feeling now? Do I wait for marriage counseling to express myself so that it is in a more constructive setting?

He says he's sorry. He says he feel like human garbage. He says he hates that he has failed me.  But... sorry doesnt make me feel much better. Sorry doesnt stop the feeling of betrayal running thru me. It doesnt stop the random thoughts that pop up in my head that make my ears feel physically hot and feeling nauseous enough to puke. It doesnt stop my heart sinking to my stomach when I hear his phone vibrate. 

At the end of the day, I want us to be ok so we can love each other. I want to have a long marriage. I dont want to be divorced. I don't want more than 1 marriage. I want us to work thru it so we can be stronger. Anybody been through anything similar?  Is an emotional affair just as bad as a physical affair? Any advice or experiences shared on helping me understand my feelings and navigating thru this for the time being before we reach a professional will be appreciated by me. 

Tldr; found condoms in husbands truck that led to me finding out he was having an emotional affair. The feelings have been intense, and would like advice on how to navigate thru them, how to understand them better, and just... other peoples experiences to feel less alone."
93,"What if my (23F) boyfriend (26M) usually wants to be alone (no call, no mssg..) whenever he feels stressed, down mood or tired... At those times, he does not feel like talking with me.

I'm just skeptical about the importance of my presence. I just want him to sit down, talk and share.
Feel like he feels comfortable being with me only when he is ok. 
I think love is sharing,
Is this situation normal?"
94,"Okay, so I'm sure this will be full of people calling me TA fro not laying off of him for a bit, but I just... don't know what to do.

My sex drive is not especially high, but decently so. When we were dating, my husband couldn't keep his hands off me. We were always sneaking off to make out and get ourselves into some kind of sexually charged situation, without actually doing the deed. I know that once we have sex the newness wears off an all that, but we've barely been married 2 years, and we have sex *maybe* once a month.

I've been taking supplements and bio-identical hormones for unrelated health issues (crippling migraines, PCOS, fatigue and permanent exhaustion, acne, etc), and one of them has an ""increased libido"" side effect. So on top of my already unsatisfied sexual relationship with my husband, I am now really fucking horny a lot of the time. I just want to have sex with him, I want to be close to him, I want to please him. I want a goddamn orgasm more than once a month.

I know, I know that he is also exhausted and has hormone problems, but he won't seek treatment for it like I am. I try not to be too demanding, but lately I literally have to beg for sex.

I mentioned it to him yesterday afternoon, just to kinda get him in that frame of mind, that I wanted sex. And when I got home I kissed him and tried to pull him into the house in like a ""sexy"" way (he was doing something in the garage). He didn't want to come in, so I went in and I put on a mini skirt and black bra and took my hair down and just looked sexy af, and started cooking dinner. When he walked in from the garage he barely noticed, and 100% didn't notice when I then dejectedly put my clothes back on.

I finished making dinner and did some laundry, and then again hinted that I wanted to have sex (by hinted I mean I said ""I want sex, can we have sex""), that I wanted him. He seemed exasperated even though it has been at least two weeks since we last had sex. 

I went to take a shower and get ready, and he turned on the xbox. I laid in bed for half an hour waiting for him, and then gave up and got up to take my bedtime supplements and then go to sleep. It was only after this that he finally came in and gave me a pretty half-assed sex session.

I should note that in most other ways, my husband is the best man I know. He is wonderful, treats me like a queen, just all around incredible. I'm not looking for the comments that say ""oh honey, divorce him!"" or whatever because that's not an option, I adore him. He is also physically attracted to me. I am a tad thicc, but he likes me that way and this has nothing to do with him being unattracted to me. We have talked about it more than once and he doesn't really feel like it's a problem, in short.

Do any of you wise, wise redditors have a suggestion? some help?

TL;DR My husband won't have sex with me unless I beg, and even then it's unsatisfying because I have to beg for it and I know it's an obligation more than a desire for him, and I can't figure out what his problem is."
95,"My ex (dated 16 months) broke up with me over a week ago and it's been really hard. We had an ugly fight the night before, and he came over to my place and told me we were through. I begged him to reconsider that whole day, then texted him the next day to say if he was unhappy with me, he should go, because I I love him so I want happy. He called me to say he appreciated this, and told me I'd be okay. I didn't hear from him until he casually texted me yesterday asking how a conference he knew I had this week went. He kept asking follow up questions but I stopped responding at a point. Honestly at this point, it feels selfish to even think about him coming back to me if he didn't want this relationship, but I also think we really stood a chance at resolving our issues because they were cause by miscommunication.

The fight was over his exes. I'm the type of person to cut out exes because I don't see how you can just go into being friends with someone who was a lover (unless maybe you were friends before dating). He however kept his exes as friends without leaving any transitional time after the breakup. So he basically had these female friends who still pined for him that he'd sometimes hang out with one on one and only tell me about after the fact. I also felt weird about him constantly liking their instragram selfies (which I know is such a silly thing) considering the fact that they still had feelings for him, so it could send the wrong message. Also, one of them was really rude to me whenever we ran into her, yet he would always defend her. I told him these relationships made me uncomfortable. He said I was being insecure, so I felt hurt. I told him I felt like he was disregarding my feelings. He came over the next morning and told me he didn't want the relationship anymore because he refused to be with someone who wanted to control him. He said the other reason was that I wasn't excited in life by anything, and thus I couldn't bring him joy. I had no idea where this came from.

I ended up convincing him to meet to talk again a little later that day. I told him I wasn't trying to cut him off from anyone, I just felt hurt that I would tell him my feelings only to have him tell me ""too bad, you're just insecure."" He said it wasn't okay for me to ask him to cut someone off, and I told him I knew that was controlling and wasn't what I was trying to do. I just felt weird about his friendships sometimes and just wanted some reassurance and to have conversation about both of our feelings rather than him dismissing me. He ended up telling me more about his exes-turned-friends, how he felt about them and what they did when they hung out together, and I realized I really had nothing to worry about. He chose me. We ended up having a really good, open conversation about the whole thing. And I realized I was wrong and apologized. But I guess it was too late... he waited to tell me this until after our break up.

Then to the point about me not being ""excited about anything in life"", I didn't know what he was talking about. I have a lot of goals and things I like doing, and I guess maybe I don't share them enough with other people. For example, I'm about to run my first 5k, I'm currently knitting myself a sweater, and this year I got really into a specific branch of philosophy. Having him tell me this did make me realize that I kind of do keep these things to myself. He just said that maybe he was wrong, but as my boyfriend it seemed to him I wasn't excited by anything and he said he felt like he didn't know what my interests were, which was honestly bizarre to hear from someone I dated over a year. Like, he definitely knows about my hobbies and the work I've been doing toward my career.

Anyway, I asked if we could just take a step back from a break up and first try to communicate more effectively and see if we could fix things. He said he didn't want to, because he felt we couldn't communicate properly. I pointed out how we had just had one of the most open conversations of our entire relationship, so it was certainly possible. But he said his decision was final, and gave me some hugs and even cried a little himself. I broke down and begged him to reconsider for like half an hour, and he got frustrated and left.

I've been thinking about him each and every day since then, but I've also been taking steps toward moving on. I realized I need to be more open about my interests with other people. I have always tended to be kind of passive in social situations. I just still think we could have worked through these issues. So, is there a chance he might come back? Is it the right decision to go NC, or perhaps not because of the part where he thought I didn't have interests and we didn't communicate well? Should I actually stay in a little bit of friendly contact so he might realize he was wrong? Then again, should I want someone whose first instinct was to leave rather than first try to talk through a problem? I can't help but feeling I'm the one who really messed up here though.

tldr: ex broke up rather than trying to talk through things first. We had a good conversation about it post break up, but he still stuck to his decision. I begged a bit the first day, but for two weeks now have been doing NC. He reached out with small talk once over text. I don't know if NC is really the right move here though, because the problems boiled down to communication issues. What should I do, and is there any chance he will reconsider?"
96,"Errr I really don't know how to feel. Though I'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. My gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so I did. She wasn't there yet, but her friend was. We chatted for a while and she started being playful, but I brushed it off. Playful turned into flirting and I felt super awkward. Before I got up she kissed me and I left right after that and called my gf. I explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. I couldn't believe it tbh, I thought she was joking at first. First she was mad that I 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much I could do. And I don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? I've never heard of someone setting up their SO and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

Where do I go from here. She has apologized (half-assed that is) but I kinda don't want to speak to her right now. We're together for 6 months."
97,"
It has been a very stressful few months for us as we moved (i got a new job in a new town).

I didn't even know how to answer her question as i was taken back.  Of course, I was hurt but i didn't know what to say.

She then offered sex but it was out of pity (she could feel i was hurt).

I don't know how to process this... Did she think i didn't feel hurt??!! 

Please offer your guidance.

Repost as I posted in the middle of the night.

Note :  she does love me in some or many regards.  I forgot some of my lunch today and she said she will bring it to my office at noon today... Maybe she feels guilty about yesterday.. Maybe she just wants me to have a normal lunch. Either way, she is thinking about me."
98,"I have posted and deleted things on reddit about my relationship before. We fought all the time and we both had kids when we finally moved in together/got married. It's been high drama ever since. The 3 years leading up to moving in was great. I guess I'd call it the honeymoon period because when we actually did get married we did not go on a honeymoon, we just started fighting. So many red flags but i was riding high on that 3 year honeymoon period and thought we'd make it through. I signed us up for couples counseling, he went once. I bought books on love languages and downloaded an app for couples to work on their relationship. I wrote him love letters and did acts of service for him.  I reached for his hand when we walked and when we laid down at night. I did all these things because I thought I could make it work. But you can't make someone love you. 
This week he told me he doesn't want to be married to me. And I finally believe him. He said it many times before but always apologized later and promised he'd do better, communicate with me, go to therapy. Id cry and try to talk it out. I think he thought this time I'd beg him to stay with me, or tell him again I didn't want to get divorced. But there have been so many highs and lows. I genuinely thought I love him so much we have to work out. But when he said he didn't want to be married to me again, after I had complained about cleaning the bathroom, I just nodded. Because he doesn't want to be with me. And frankly, I don't want to be with someone that doesn't want to be with me. 
I'm sad he does not reciprocate my feelings. I'm mad I married him in the first place. Im all kinds of upset but I'm also resigned to take care of my family and myself. 
Except now he won't leave our house. He asked if he could use my car to go to Vegas next week. He asked me to turn on my location services on my phone again so he can track me on Google maps. Then he took off his wedding ring and said he'd get some boxes for his stuff. He's been sleeping in the spare room ever since. 
We're all in this house right now because neither of us can afford to pay for separate residences but I'm miserable sharing a place with someone who doesn't want to be with me. I know time heals all things but I'm stuck in the worst of it right now. How do I cope in the meantime?

TLDR: husband wants a divorce and we're stuck living in our house until we sell it. How do I get through this?"
99,"I [F30] discovered my boyfriend [M37] had been flirting with numerous women through social media three months after we had committed to a relationship. 

He knew he wanted to marry me the moment he saw me; we both knew we would have to be in a long distance relationship if we decided to try things out. He took the lead, apparently adamant to show me how much I meant to him - he even booked a ticket to my home country to meet my Parents and spend time with me. 

I had my suspicions about his behavior and how he spoke with women - colleagues and friends alike - but whenever I voiced my concerns, he made it seem as though I was overanalyzing him and I often felt like I was crazy. 

I went to his home country for six months of this year to spend time with him and get to know his family, friends, and life. This in turn furthered my suspicions especially when certain things didn’t quite add up. 

Eventually, towards the end of my stay (we had been together for a year at this point), I discovered through checking his social media (the app of which he deleted when we had a huge argument over his liking a photo of a half naked woman three months into our relationship - ironically!) that he had been engaging numerous women, casually flirting with them or referring to things that occurred in real life (one woman thanked him for the massage he gave her and she also had cooked him rice one day - he never mentioned that to me!), and there were some instances of almost sexual bantering and borderline questionable intentional innuendos.

He claims he thought we would never work out - I asked him why would he then tell me he wanted to marry me and commit to booking costly plane tickets to meet my family? He also claims he was in a different frame of mind and even once flirted with someone just to spite me after we had the fight over his liking a half naked photo, which greatly upset me but apparently made him want to seek revenge?!

He knows I consider what he did as cheating, it’s crossing a line I personally don’t agree with and he didn’t either when we initially discussed it. He was remorseful and has been working to show me he has changed and genuinely never meant to hurt me but acted out due to lack of self confidence, and not believing our relationship would ever work. 

We barely had time to make amends after I discovered the truth before I flew back to my home country. I have been struggling a lot with how to deal with everything that has transpired and wonder whether I’m being unreasonable, however I can’t help but feel deeply hurt and distrustful. 

Would appreciate thoughts or advice on any part of this; I’m sharing my experience in the hopes it helps me heal one way or another.


TLDR; I found out my boyfriend of one year had been flirting with numerous women via social media both innocently and borderline sexually for the first three months of our relationship. I’m wondering how to move on from this discovery."
100,"Yeah I know, never shit where you eat. I've met this girl at work through some sort of team meet and I caught her checking me out so I chatted her up via email and we exchanged numbers. Three dates later we had sex and everything was cool, actually thinking about going for a relationship with her. Three weeks later I asked her if she wants to spent the  night but she declined saying that it's getting too serious for her and she wasnt ready for commitment. This has to do with her being in a long relationship with abuse in the end which she ended a couple months ago but still cant get over her ex. We texted (yeah I know) about our thing ending and she told me I'm too sweet and its not my fault she isnt over her ex yada yada. Well that was around three weeks ago, we're still texting and meeting up for small talk in the office and I cant get her out of my head and actually often initiate the texts or meetups even though I know its tilting me. 

How do I stop being dumb? I never really did get closure besides an evening of texting and really like her, I know I'm getting hurt in the end anyway so I might as well try to stop it."
101,"Background: I was married to my ex-husband for 4.5 years, and we met when I was 19 and he was 29. We separated July 2018, and were legally divorced in April 2019. My son was 18 months when we separated, he will be 3 in December. Our divorce was completly cordial, and we even tried counseling for 6 months before we separated. We have 50/50 custody with a schedule we made of our own, 3 days one week and 4 the next. We made certain promises to each other for the sake of our son. Things like: doing holidays together when we can, specifically his Birthday. Meeting quarterly for dinner to discuss changes in behavior upcoming scheduling changes needed, etc. Taking emotions out of decisions and doing what's best for our son, but also communicating when we have issues. We also said we would let the other person know when we were serious with someone, and they could meet the other parent before they met our son. We also video chat every night so the other person can see our son. I spent last Thanksgiving with my ex and our son, and found hateful text messages about me when he asked me to change a song. (I know I 100% evaded his privacy and should not have. I had no right). I didn't bring up the text messages over dinner because it wouldn't have benefited my son, I was hurt because we had been so cordial and still friends and I went out of my way to do Thanksgiving with him to make him not be lonely the first holiday after our divorce. That's why I decided after that day, we would only do his Birthday together and do the holidays we are supposed to have in the Divorce Decree. Celebrate before and after the holiday if we dont have our son. This upset my ex-husband because he wanted to do Thanksgiving 2019 together, even though it is his day. I will say that his family has not spoken with me since the divorce and they won't come to Thanksgiving if I am there. I told him to do Thanksgiving with his family and our son. I was going to Lousiana with my boyfriend of 3 months. This upset him and he said I was going back on my word, which is why I think he is doing what he is doing now. So to present day. My boyfriend met my son 3 weeks ago,after being together 2 months, but I gave my ex the option of meeting him before he met our son. He said he didn't really have to meet him, but he could meet my BF when my BF met my son. My therapist encouraged me to separate the visits so my son wouldn't feel pressured, confused and actually get to know my BF without a ""pissing match"". My ex-husband didn't want to meet him before and we left it at that. I still told him I would like to meet his girlfriend before she meets our son. He told me sunday he was talking to someone and they were having their first date monday. I video chatted him at 6, so he could go on his date and still talk to our son before. He tells me Monday that his new friend will be be coming to the fall festival Wednesday at our son's school. Which is fine, because my boyfriend was coming too and I would get to meet his friend, and he could meet my boyfriend. Also, at the same time I felt that would be overwhelming for our son meeting his friend and my ex meeting my boyfriend all at the same time. The fall festival is actually next week and I got the dates wrong. No biggie. Well we normally video chat around 6:30 when he has our son, and it was 7:15 last night and he still hadn't video chatted me... When he has friends over that are men, he will still video chat. I automatically knew he was with a women, but I just wanted to talk to my son and was kinda pissed my son was meeting his friend so soon, since they had been dating a week, before I met her. Also, that he was acting different since she was there. He said since they were gonna meet that night anyways he just kept it on schedule. I just wanted the chance to meet her before and he could have given me a courtesy call/text like I gave him. Am I wrong in feeling this way? Also after a week and she is meeting our kid? Am I crazy for being upset about that. Mind you, we married fast and he said I love you after 3 days so I sense yet again he is rushing things. I realize I am not his priority anymore and he will not think about me first. I do not wish any ill will on him, but this is his second girlfriend since our divorce and they never last longer than a few weeks. I just dont want a bunch of women being introduced, so our son is confused. Also, I don't want to be a bitch or make it harder for my ex-husband to find happines like I have and move on. Any advice on how to get through this, process it, tips, dos and donts? Please don't be rude as I am human and just trying to figure it out, just be blunt with advice. Sorry if this is scattered."
102,"Was in a relationship for about 8-9 months with my (24F) ex(27M). He suffers from chronic depression and anxiety. In the beginning of the relationship,he was healthy and in a good place,but after a few months he got very depressed, attempted suicide, and has been having terrible anxiety. To the extent,where he cannot step out of the house.

He broke up with me a month ago,saying he couldn't handle a relationship,I'm hurt but I accept he needs to look after himself now. We are still in limited contact though.

At present,he has refused to take any form of treatment. He goes to the gym(saying it's helped him in the past,though his health has never gotten so bad) whenever he can. I'm very happy he does this because I know how incredibly difficult it is,but at the same time I know he needs to get professional help because he is still in a very bad place. He also does not speak to anyone about it (he pretty much only told me,but not the full extent).

So yeah, without pushing him,how can I be there for him and try to get him to seek help?"
103,"We were in love, the feelings were there.  Then suddenly it was gone.  And it seems like he doesn't love me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

How can someone who I had such a romantic connection with fall out of love so quickly?  So suddenly? I don't understand."
104,"I really liked him, we had 3 dates and one weekend trip. But I stopped seeing him because

1.he only contacts me when he wants

2.Never set a specific plan to see me even though he plans to come to visit my city(I live in the city center and he travels to hangout here from time to time-3 hours away by train)

2-1. He contacts when he visits my city but only on that day (for example he comes my city for the weekend but only asks me if i am free like at 4pm of Saturday or Sunday)

3.Yet he drunk-face time me and introduce me as his gf over the phone to his friends

I tried to keep hope, even visited his town cause otherwise I can not really see with plans, but he never changed on “only seeing or contacting me when he wants to” so I left him a message saying

&lt;I  want to move on, I start to see another person. How he treated me was really shitty (like he would call me a gf one day but be silence for two weeks on another day) and I don’t deserve this. But still I like him as a person since we share a lot of common interests and always have a good time, so maybe we could meet as friends, but not this way.&gt;

I got a reply “no that’s not how I feel. i care a lot about you” and one missed call. I have not replied and it has been two months we did not keep in touch.

Today he texted me saying “how have you been doing? I have been thinking about you recently”

And I don’t know if I should respond to him or just ignore. (By the way I have no intention to be with him anymore)"
105,I’m a college student that met someone over the summer. We had a serious talk in the beginning of it all and he said he wasn’t really looking for a relationship but wanted to keep seeing me. I wanted more than that but instead of leaving I stuck around. I am from Cali studying abroad abroad in Russia. Before I left he said he was developing real feelings and we’ve been maintaining our relationship for about two months. He’s spending like $1000 to come visit me for my week off but I still feel like he isn’t as emotionally invested as I am and he said he doesn’t know what he wants. What should I do?
106,"We have been dating for about a year and a half and I had zero reason or suspicion to think she would cheat but she started talking to a lot more guys on Snapchat and texting them, claiming they were all friends when I asked. Also it seemed like every night we hangout she gets a call from a guy ( idk if it’s the same guy she gives me different names) and she talks to them for 15 - 30 mins every time but the thing is she always says she’s at “her friends place” and things like that. Anyways I went on her phone while she was in the bathroom tonight and I saw lots of dirty talk and clearly they want to have sex but I couldn’t look long enough to see if they had talked about previously having sex or plans to. I don’t think she will be honest with me if I ask her. How do I get proof of her cheating?"
107,"Sorry for my English, my mother tongue it's another but I saw that most posts and searches are in English, so I'll try my best.

I don't know how to resume this so there it goes:

We have 3 years togheter and we're building a lot of proyects togheter. We were dating at first for 1 year and moved togheter then. After a year we moved again to the capital of the province for jobs upgrades, we married and after a year again from the last moving we moved abroad.
 We had our discussions about circumstances that we had, but nothing serious. I think we are a great nerd couple, we laugh a lot and have a lot in common. I love him really much but it's a long time that I have job problems because of my history life background.
 I've never been able to study something that I like because of economic and family problems so I've never had a job that I like. Then my life changed because a met him. I was very depressed because my all my suffering with my very hard environment (I lived in a poor country with socialism). They want for me a better life a better future. 
So in our second year he told me to quit my job and search for something else (before that i chose to enrolled in a college but not in a career that i like). So I decided to go for another subject; the one my husband learned. I was pretty curious and his passion inspired me a lot. Thus, he suggested me to study in a self-taught way, with his guidance. I accepted with the condition that I do it like a job. Was hard but I persevered. I went to meetups and met more people involved in the subject. I suffer a lot, knowing it was the best for me, and in less than a year I achieved a lot. 

However, my nerves and tension rarely were at minimum levels, I'm really bad with stress and anxiety control (since the end of school I'm trying to achieve something better for my life, failing). And my husband is a really hardcore decisive person, extreme organized and cold brain. That's why he achieved his personal goals (and continues doing that). And sometimes I cannot contain my frustration and I go down and I miss my focus and make mistakes with my tasks, and manage wrong the priorities and miss attention.... Those things ends in misundertandings and dicussions with him...and since a year that all that things are making me more intreverted with my body and feeling low in sexual encounters... Not my affectionates, I've never miss my affection for him and I keep cooking thinking on him... But I'm seeing that he's starting to feel undesirable and that I don't like him a sexual way. And I feel that it's not that. But he is not wanting to listen...

I think he's right to feel that way... almost a year that our sexual encounters were decreasing. Sometimes 2 months pass and I we don't do anything (me always rejecting). As we're settle down it's all difficult and I feel that he's blaming me for being so stressfull... And everytime I refuse to have relationships he gets more sad and digusted... Because he feels he's doing everything to give me a better life and i'm not responding accordinly.... Why this has to be a problem? why he is not asking himself that is him that it's making things harder? I'm trying to chill but everytime he insists again like thinking ""this time she will be more relaxed"", And NOT! it's not that I'm relaxed or not...I'm not good! Why it's has to be so selfish! ... Is not listening my words, my body... It's horrible to feel that way... he's a good person really... but sometimes it's too selfish... And I'm don't have any person to tell this... I've never had true friends... I don't have my mom (she passed away long long ago..) I don't know who to talk... Sorry for so long wall of text... If anybody has some advice, really it would be very helpful..."
108,"We moved to a totally different country about 5 years ago.
Ever since I started high school she's been shouting at me and making me cry on basically daily basis.

I get bullied (Not alot mostly name calling), and don't have many friends, only people I talk to, are people I met online over PlayStation.
My mom limits the amount of time I can talk to them (on Mondays and Thursday I'm straight up not allowed any electric devices)

She doesn't give a fuck about how I'm doing in school, and she appears to only care about me once I do something wrong (She doesn't go to any school meeting neither does she know any of my teachers)

My dad works daily till about 17 where he eats dinner and then goes sleeps at about 20.

I also have a brother (age 11), which is obviously their favorite even though he lies to them all the time, it gotten to the point where my parents will tell me I DID something even though it was obviously him.

I just can't anymore, I'm honestly scared of my parents"
109,"Hello Reddit peeps i have this crush on a girl for over a year now .
 I tried to ask her out she said once that she wasn't ready and i asked later again(months later) but now she kinda ignores me sometimes but also shows her intrest sometimes (girls are weird).

I feel like she is doesn't want to admit or maybe i am being negative that she is not interested in me at all.
 So now over a year later i am back in a relationship trying to forget her(the crush) and this girl i have relationship with really loves me alot and i do love her too probably not as much as she does.

But this crush keeps coming in my mind and dreams and i have no idea what to do I don't wanna hurt the girl i am in relationship with right now.
And i also don't have much friends or any to talk with😶
#feelinglost"
110,"So, me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years now and we are currently engaged.
We also live together and are both in our early 20’s. 
Our relationship has had ups and downs like every relationship; but it’s always been solid and we made it through the rough times.
This last years in particular has been hard on us both.
Due to circumstances i had to move back to my homecountry for 10 (very long) months and looking for an apartment and planning our future while in a long distance relationship has been very stressfull.
I’d like to point out that my fiancé has always been an extremely sweet man.
Very calm, gentle and caring.
We’be known each other since we were 16 and over the years he’s changed a lot for the better.
However; lately a lot of out of the ordinary things have been happening...

During the last 2 months he’s been very aggressive and acts completely out of character towards me. 
In the time of 2 weeks we got into silly arguments that ended up twice in me having bruises caused by him. 
The second time was so bad i could not walk for a day due to a huge bruise on my leg; so i decided to stay at my friend’s house for a while.
We talked it out and he started therapy.
I know a lot of people would say « Why didn’t you just leave? » and the answer is : because he caught me by surprise. And by that i mean that my boyfriend is such a calm person that its rare to even hear him raise his voice. So i decided to give therapy a chance; because he’s not aggressive by nature and i’d like to see if we can work this out.
At this point i simply don’t know what to think anymore. 
It’s been a months since the last time he hit me, but he’s pulled/pushed me a couple times.
He also gets irritated quicker than he used to.
Right now i have no intentions of leaving this relationship; but i wonder if there are things besides therapy and communication to get through this. 
I’d also like to say that he’s never acted like this before in his previous relationships nor friendships. 
I’m just very confused and scared to lose the person i love because of this. 
I won’t leave now; but there’s just so much a person can take.

Any advice? (Excuse my bad grammar; english is not my first language)"
111,"""Boyfriend"" here struggling to make ends meet in my both my career and in my relationship. My girlfriend and I fight, bicker or argue everyday. It's very unbearable. I'm unable to focus on myself and what I need to do to become the best version of myself.

Because of her jealousy, I've had to terminate all of my social media accounts because she would frequently scrutinize my friends lists and ask, ""who the f*** is this?!"" This morning at 7am, she lurked my LinkedIn connections and literally just accused me of having some sort of relationship with her friend's mother at a company I interned at during university. I'm convinced that it's just a person with the same last name. During her tantrums, she spit on me, broke a small gift that I got her, and threw som chairs around, breaking one. It was insane. I just left the apartment to attend a networking event. 15 minutes before all of this, she and I talked briefly about marriage.

This is not the first time this has happened. A week or so ago, she had another one of her tantrums and was hitting/striking me AND called the police on me ""for advice."" It was absolutely absurd. Now you must think that I'm crazy for being in this relationship. I agree, but I'm not sure how to deal with this. At times, I feel very bad for her. She's been unemployed for almost a year now, constantly has to worry about money from her parents, and is dealing with a lot of student visa stuff. There's just a lot of instability.

All in all, she gets jealous over everything. Everytime we're in public, I'm getting accused of ""looking at and checking out other women."" I'm just getting sick of it all and frequently wonder what it's like and what I can accomplish if only if I was single. All the time I have I spend coddling her and/or arguing with her. She is not the girl I met at first and it is devastating.

She has completely alienated herself from her friends and I really can't understand why she hates them so much and feels like she has to compete with them. It's the most uncomfortable thing ever when we spend time with her friends because I know afterwards, she will (1) accuse me of something and (2) get extremely jealous over something really stupid and completely misconstrue and overdramatize things.

It's gotten to the point where I've become ultra-manipulated and I want out. How do I move forward?

tl;dr how do I gracefully deal with 3+ yr relationship with a girl who is prone to absurd tantrums, emotional breakdowns, violent shouting, constant confusion in the direction of her life, and extreme jealousy?"
112,"Throwaway because he knows my personal account.

My BF and I were laying in bed both looking at Reddit on my phone when a notification for a Snapchat message from a guy I previously dated popped up. I'll refer to him as ""EX"" for simplicity but we were never actually in a relationship, just went on two or three dates before I met my current BF and it never went anywhere. I don't care much about messages and notifications from people unless it's someone important to me or close family that I talk to regularly so I don't often check messages immediately and BF knows this. Since I was laying in bed with BF and enjoying time with him looking at Reddit, I didn't feel the need to go check the message and just ignored the notification and continued looking at Reddit with him. 

After a few minutes BF asked what EX said and I told him obviously I had no idea since I hadn't looked at the message yet. I hadn't already been having a conversation with EX and wasn't expecting a message from him. I don't have anything to hide and wasn't trying to not open the message in front of BF, I just didn't care to check it at the moment while spending time with BF. 

After 30 or so minutes I got up to go to the bathroom before bed and left my phone on the night stand. When I came back BF said he felt sick and got up and went to the bathroom. It was weird that he suddenly felt sick and something felt off so I looked at my phone. The notification from EX was gone, which was weird since I hadn't cleared it. I then opened Snapchat and the message from EX was gone. (If you don't know about Snapchat, messages either disappear immediately after opening or after 24 hours depending on your settings.) It became clear to me that BF had gone in my phone and opened the message from EX because the notification was gone and the message no longer existed. 

When BF came back from the bathroom I didn't accuse him of anything but acknowledged that the notification and message were gone and he just said ""Huh that's wild"" and went to sleep. I let it go and went to bed but the next day it was still bothering me so I brought it up again. He insisted for an hour of talking that he didn't touch my phone before finally admitting that he had opened my phone to google something but never opened Snapchat or cleared anything. I asked what he googled and he couldn't remember so I opened my internet search history and nothing was there. He then said that he had opened the phone to google something but forgot what he wanted to search then and just put the phone back down. Additionally, he said he used my phone because he couldn't find his but by the time I came out of the bathroom he had his phone in his hand. 

None of this was making sense so I continued pressing the issue and after another hour telling me that he wasn't lying, that he didn't understand why I was making a big deal out of nothing, and that I could ""give me a polygraph and I'll pass"", he finally said that he and his ex used to take funny pictures on each others Snapchat accounts and save them so that the other would find them later and he opened Snapchat to do that on my phone. He said he didn't look at the message so that may have been why the notification was gone but he didn't know why the message was gone. 

He hadn't actually taken any pictures and saved them so his story still wasn't making any sense. Again after talking about it for a while he admitted that he opened snapchat and it automatically opened to the message from EX. He said he didn't read the message but he heard me wrapping up in the bathroom and didn't want me to think he was intentionally looking through my phone so he just closed everything and put the phone back down.

We agreed to try to work through this but after a few weeks it's still bothering me. The last guy I was in a serious relationship with cheated on me multiple times and when I would confront him about it he would gaslight me and tell me I was making a big deal out of nothing and convince me I was being crazy to even accuse him of such a thing. My current BF knows about this and it's hard for me to deal with knowing that he would do the same thing.

Additionally, I later asked EX what the message said. It was about a specific topic that BF has brought up multiple times since this whole thing happened so I know for a fact that he did actually read the message and lied about that to but haven't brought it up with him.

I also want to note that having EX on Snapchat isn't weird for my relationship with BF. BF and I both regularly use Snapchat with each other and other friends and he has multiple women he's seriously dated as friends on there. Our friendly relationships with exs have never been an issue before this. 

We've only known each other and dated for less than a year and I don't know if this is a red flag that I should get out now or if I should try to work through this still. Any advice is appreciated."
113,"Hey, I'm 20 years old and a junior in college. By this point in my life, I've never had a girlfriend, first kiss, first cuddles, a true first date and I'm still a virgin. Sometimes, I feel like I'm never going to experience those things. I try to remain positive about it, but it's tough to keep that in mind.

For some reason, girls have just never been interested in me. I always try hard to get them to like me but it has never worked out. They've often called me ugly and disrespected me in numerous ways. 

I'm a very friendly, down to earth guy, who does well in school. People always tell me that my future is bright and I'm going to be very successful in my field. But why don't girls like me? I think that the reason could come down to me being shy and socially awkward. 

Do you think I just haven't met ""the right girl"" yet?"
114,"23M/26F 

It’s really early on, so I don’t know how much of a problem it will be. I’m used to dating guys who want to have sex multiple times a day. From what I’ve gathered we could rarely have PiV sex. He has an issue that makes it really hard for him to maintain an erection during sex, but blowjobs and handjobs work. He said he “doesn’t really have sensitivity in his penis.” He’s great at head, though...I really, really like him, and am willing to work with that in the bedroom. I feel like we could make some sort of progress, but I don’t think out sex life will ever be “normal” The other issue is, when I send him a sexy pic/text he doesn’t seem to be phased by it. I know it’s not about me, but I like attention so that kind of sucks. I still want to see where things go, though. We are very compatible otherwise. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation?"
115,"I have been dating an amazing guy for 4 months now. 

As a bit of background, I had been in an emotionally abusive relationship prior to him. So I’ve experienced being lovebombed/manipulated/controlled. 

I’d say our relationship was healthy, although for the first few months it was unequal. He was always forthcoming in his feelings towards me, highly affectionate and vocal as to how much he adored me, how he has never felt this way before. For me, it took longer for my feelings to develop. I struggled with feelings towards other men, regretted not being single at times, had a good time on nights out. Eventually though, I fell for him hard and now I absolutely adore him. We have a wonderful relationship which is open and incredible chemistry that I have never experienced. 

The thing is, I messed up. I lied to him regarding my behaviours both before our relationship and in the very early stages. I was ashamed of my behaviour and selfishly worried that he would leave me if he found out about how I’d slept with men casually before him, how I’d still been talking to another man in the first few weeks of seeing him, how I’d acted on nights out in those first few weeks. 

He found out of course and the lies started to come out. Yes I messed up phenomenally however he expressed that he still wanted to date me, he still wanted to be with me and work through this. That no relationship is perfect. 

My issue is, he told me himself that this has impacted him and that I have “come off the pedestal” (his words), that he loves me less carefree than before, and that he is not as infatuated as before. He has also mentioned that it’s just not as amazing as before, that he isn’t as completely trusting in love. 

Of course that’s to be expected given my lies. My concern is how worried I should be about the shift in his feelings. Yes he wants to stay with me but are these feelings going to develop into resentment? Are they going to keep dwindling?

Might he meet a girl who ticks all the boxes and be tempted by them? Could he then feel about me how he felt about his exes, who he’s told me many times he never truly cared about on a deeper level? Should I recognise that his feelings have changed and suggest we end things, or is there a chance I can rebuild his trust?

**tldr** Broke my boyfriends trust by lying and although he says he wants to be with me, he has admitted that his feelings have changed. Should I be worried that this is going to develop into resentment or him wanting other women because he is not as enamoured by me?"
116,"Edit: Looong

Hello. Throw away (obviously). Ive been in a relationship with my boyfriend (let’s call him L) for around 5 years. We started dating my freshman and his junior year of high school. I feel like I am slowly starting to resent him.

I had been madly in love with L since I had met him. He is amazing. Goofy, ambitious, really level-headed, even when he was a stupid teenage boy. A year into our relationship was pretty rocky due to my own personal issues. I am still battling with long standing anxiety and an eating disorder; my self esteem was shot. It felt like I needed the attraction of 100 people to get me through the day. Three years later I am not perfect or fixed, but I am better.  I am not someone who complains about L to friends without openly acknowledging my mistakes. To make a point clear: I had never had any sort of physical relationship with anyone while we were together. It was more like entertaining guys I should not have been.

Things were good when we did not have real stuff to worry about. Now we both work, go to school, and still try to keep up on hobbies. We dont really have a social life. I have one good friend and he has a few but none he hangs out with outside of work. We are together any time we can be (nearly 100% of our free time). 

I am currently going through some pretty tough stuff lately (bird leaving the nest...more like innocent prisoner escaping as I am almost positive my abusive mother is kicking me out), financial issues, car issues, school stress, holiday work season. On top of this...Ive realized all we do is fight. The stress is killing my sex drive. We do have sex, not because I want to, but because I feel bad for neglecting him. We used to have sex a lot in the beginning, which he reminds me of constantly. Being inconvenienced at home and school really puts me on edge, but all he does is nag at me for over reacting and being too sensitive..Some days my anxiety is so bad I can barely crawl out of bed. To him Im a slacker. I tell him I need a better job with better wages; I must be asking for handouts. I drive too close to the curb in the car; he berates me for all the mistakes the rest of the car ride. I cry, he feels guilty and gets mad; we fight, he feels Im too aggressive and mean. I express negative thoughts about myself and my life..he ignores them. 70% of our time together we fight about all of this. Every time I express some sort of concern about his interactions with other women (we’ve been together 5 years..of course Im going to question why he is all over an old fling’s social media and receives late night notifications from her when I have to see it) it circles back to my mistakes 4 years ago. Im not allowed to have guy friends but he can talk it up with all of the girls at his job and in class. I willfully ignore his toxic behavior because I just dont feel like hearing about everything Ive ever done wrong every time he does something mean or sketchy. 

Now everytime Im with him, I just want him to go away. I feel like such a burden. I try to express real concerns, he gets defensive. It feels like I am repressing a part of me that everyone else likes. 

When Im with him, Im angry and bitter. When Im with my friend/at work, Im a complete 180. Now I do sneaky stuff. I have a guy friend at work L knows about but doesnt like. We talk quite often, completely harmless stuff. We are basically eachother’s diary. He feels like a childhood friend. I have an old friend from high school who I smoke with late at night. He helps me with cars. Ive reconnected with a friend L hates. She’s my backbone. When I am away from L, I see so much more fun in life. I could hang out and do nothing with these people and have the time of my life. When I am with L I feel like everything I do is being criticized and he’s just waiting for my next fuck up. 

And then I wake up next to him in the morning and I feel like such an absolute scum of a girlfriend for feeling this way. Im not perfect. I can be really mean sometimes. When I get upset, it’s 0-100 in seconds. I know most of the time, I can be impossible. 

He isn’t screaming in my face all the time. He doesn’t hit me (Ive actually hit him before). He isn’t keeping me in a financial chokehold, he actually helps when I need it. He takes me out, buys me gifts. He tries. When he looks at me I can see the love in there. And then I have to look him in the eyes and present him with my lame effort of love that is weakly hanging by a thread. 

**TL;DR:** I kind of hate my boyfriend of 5 years because he is kind of toxic in my opinion but I feel like it’s all my fault so Im not really sure what to do right now."
117,"I didnt know what to do so i went along with the conventional wisdom and decided to date myself for a while.

Im now 3 years deep into the most abusive relationship ive ever had."
118,"So a little background my Girlfriend and I are both 21 years old we are high school sweethearts. We started dating when I was 13. She is the love of my life and my bestfriend. I would do anything for her and she for me. I didnt have the best childhood. Wont go into detail as that's not important but my hometown just doesn't feel like home to me and never has. I've always dream of living at the beach my passion has always been the ocean. Ever since I was a little kid I wanted to be a Marine Biologist, but coming from a very blue collar family that was just a dream. As I got older and became a more independent adult I realized that didnt have to be a dream. I tried to get her to move or even consider that possibility of it but she wont budge. I have worked in the trades since we graduated high school and supported us while she is in college, but every passing day I just become more miserable and feel like life is going nowhere. I'm a very passionate person and settling for something has really never been something I do. At the same time the this girl is my whole world I've thought about breaking things off but the idea of life without her is something I cant even imagine. On the other hand staying in my hometown and working a job that I hate everyday just isn't going to cut it for me. Any advice or accounts of someone who has been in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated , thanks !"
119,"Throwaway account and didn't read the meta before to create it with the right name, sorry. Ok, here it goes, I'll call my gf Alice, some background first:

I've been in two long term relationships before and in the last one I was cheated on quite nasty and it ended on very bad terms. I don't have feelings for my ex anymore and definitely don't want to go back, but I think I'm still hurt. On the other hand, Alice was also cheated on in her previous relationship so I think it's a very delicate combination. However,  I trust her completely and it seems she trusts me too, so I don't think I have trust issues but might have some anger issues from my previous relationship.

Me and Alice started dating not long after we broke up with our previous partners (about a month) so I assume we didn't have much time to heal and deal with the breakups. Nonetheless, we hit it off right from the start and its been great since then, we get along perfectly and we make a great couple and an excellent team. I love her to pieces and I really like the way she is and admire her for what she has accomplished and I'm sure she loves me back. We don't live together but we see each other practically everyday after work and basically, the sex is great, she is a great GF, I'm a great BF and everything is a bed of roses except when we fight. 

There has never been physical violence or insults or name calling by the way, but it's always a tedious fight in which none of us yields an inch. The fights start from small unimportant things but tend to grow like a snowball. Most of the time I handle fights logically and with a cold head, while Alice is a little bit more emotional and heated but I feel I have grown more intolerant because I wasn't like this in my previous relationships and I feel she is too proud to accept her mistakes and to apologize. I don't mind fighting in a relationship but we are both stubborn when we fight trying to impose our viewpoints. 

For example, our last fight was like this: 

\-Me: I'm going to visit my sister at what time do you get out of work?  
\-Her: At 6pm.  
\-Me: What are you going to do when you get out of work? (Wanted to know if she was available to go with me)  
\-Her: Nothing because it seems you don't want me to go with you.  
\-Me: Of course I want you to go with me  
\-Her: Then why didn't you invite me?   
\-Me: I was about to invite you.   
\-Her: But you didn't   
\-Me: I know I didn't because you didn't let me, but I was about to.  
\-Her: You're only saying that because I said you hadn't invited me

etc, etc, It went along those lines for almost a day. She was very irrational but I'm not trying to come out clean, I know I've been irrational also and it seems we fight weekly either one of us starts the fight. When the fight eventually ends we both end up feeling very sad for what we did/said.

Kind and wise strangers from the internet, is there any hope? We don't want to break up, so how can we change this kind of behavior in the relationship? How can both of us be more tolerant with one another? 

TL;DR: Me and my gf are madly in love but fight quite a bit over trivial stuff."
120,"Background: I’m very introverted. I got into a serious relationship at the start of the year. It was perfect, even up to the final day of the relationship. Then there was a random incident that became a huge misunderstanding. My (now ex)partner and I didn’t handle it well, and it blew up. That’s another story, but the breakup got ugly quick. To the point my few friends pretty much took her side and don’t talk to me anymore. I grieved for a month or two, before finally working on “getting myself out there”. And it hasn’t been going all that well.

Anyways, the date. We met on a dating app and met in person last night for the first time. I took some advice (I think from this sub) to go to the park with my dog for a walk. At first my dog was a pain, because it was a new place and he wanted to sniff all the things, but he’s overall a good boy and well-behaved. It did distract me from engaging conversation at first. Especially initially with the awkwardness of first meeting someone.

There weren’t many breaks in the conversation. And it definitely got a lot better as the night the went on. However, she kept saying it was awkward. Like multiple times. For example, there’s this dog friendly cafe in the park, and I had suggested we could stop there for drinks to sit down and be less distracted, but she said “I don’t know, I feel awkward.”

Like I said, things got better and better and she opened up. We even talked about more serious things. Possibly even something revealing to why it didn’t end up well... She asked if I’ve met anyone else from the app ever, and I said no, you’re my first. She said I’m only her second and she “doesn’t really date” and is more interested in serious relationships. I thought, well how do you get into serious relationships? But I kind of agreed with her, and she asked when my last one was. I was honest and said it ended a few months ago. She said it “wow, so very recent”. Hers was almost a year prior and she did mention how she thinks it good to be alone for awhile.

Anyways, we got back to our cars. I again suggested maybe next we can sit down somewhere next time if she wants to do this again. Once again, she said “No, this was really awkward. I’m sorry.” And we went our separate ways. I sent her a follow up text later, thanking her for coming out and apologizing she felt awkward. I also asked if there was anything I could’ve done better. All she said was “To put it simply, there wasn’t chemistry” and not much else.

I’m not upset about the rejection or anything, but it did kill my confidence. And left me confused. Personally, I thought there was chemistry. I mean, I felt awkward too, but only because it was a first date and we were meeting someone new.

Do you think she just wasn’t attracted to me? Physically or otherwise? Or thought maybe she thought it was too soon for me to be dating again? Possibly not even over her own breakup?

And is there anything else you think I could’ve done better? Other than the outcome, I was pretty happy with how things went. I’m normally so quiet, but I talked quite a bit. And not too much either—conversation was definitely 50/50. I have another date tomorrow night and now I'm questioning it."
121,"This is going to be a bit hard to explain. 

Recently I've entered a new relationship with a great guy (M23). It's long distance at the moment but we have enough opportunities to visit and we are both finished with our uni degrees in a year. 

The problem is the fact that since my last (and only) adult relationship with my ex, I've been struggling to connect with anyone. I feel emotionally dead inside. I've started dating my new boyfriend in the hopes that since he's really my type in theory, I would eventually feel something for him. It's been two months and I'm losing hope. 

The reason why I'm starting to panic about it instead of moving on and waiting for something better to come along is that I don't think anything better exists. I've been on endless amount of dates, I've tried with all kinds of different guys and it's always the same. I feel nothing. No attraction, no emotions, nothing. 

And I don't believe that everyone could be just that wrong for me. 

Otherwise I'm pretty happy in other aspects of my life and unfortunately, lately I've been happiest by myself, just focusing on school, working out and minding my own business (including ignoring most of my friends). 

I don't think I haven't moved on from my ex because the thought of seeing him or talking to him is disgusting to me. However, the feelings of betrayal are still quite fresh (it's been over a year since the break up). I can't move past how much it hurt me. I feel like something horrible happened to me but I couldn't even say what it was. 

I know that this is probably the reason why I'm having a hard time with my current relationships but I honestly don't know what else I could do to get better. If anyone has any advice, please share."
122,"Hi redditors. I need some advice.

So, to put things into context, my boyfriend and I have a long distance relationship and we've been together for close to 3 years now. Our towns are less than an hour away from each other, but due to commitments to college and work we don't get much time to visit one another. So how we usually spend time is by playing some online video games after I get home from work. We usually played games like Overwatch, WoW, Divinity OS 2 and the likes. Now my bf has an issue on Wow where he will keep making different characters that he wants to main and I'm stuck waiting for him to catch their levels up to my character so we can play. So, I decided to pick up League of Legends, a game that he loves and has asked me to play with him before, so that we can spend time together while he levels up his character in WoW when I'm at work.

So. I don't know how many of you are familiar with MOBAs like League, but they have quite the learning curve to them and if a single person in your team of 5 does badly the entire team can suffer. I myself am not very familiar or even good at MOBAs but my bf said we'd work on getting me to play better. It's been around two months and I'm still really bad at it.

My problem comes from the game (which I do enjoy) being unbearable to play with my bf. If I do badly he gets annoyed and frustrated (Naturally. Anybody would have this reaction) and it becomes very clear and he takes it out on me. He believes all he does is give me tips and point out mistakes, but his tone of voice is very hostile and the sighs are highly audible. It's honestly terrible to play with someone who keeps nitpicking or lose their temper when you do worse than usual and really sucks the fun out of the game.

Two nights ago, we were playing and I was doing poorly, which meant the sighs and horrible tone of voice was back. And at one point after joining a new match, my game crashed while loading. Of course this was frustrating to me as I was now stuck on a loading screen unable to alt-tab or alt-F4 out of it, meaning I had to restart my computer. I told him that I'm stuck on the loading screen and his reaction was ""Well you're going to have to restart your computer if you hope to play."" So I restarted my computer and while waiting for it to boot up my bf let me know that the match had been remade (basically the game can be cancelled after 3 minutes if a player got disconnected during the loading phase) and i just replied ""k"" as I was focussing on opening the game back up and loading up discord. When I said this he just said ""You know what. I think I'm done for the night if you're going to act like this.""

So, in response, I called him out for his double standards. How everything in the world was hunky dory if he got to take out his frustration on me and I just have to take it, but god forbid I show the slightest sign of frustration. This led to an argument that night.

Yesterday morning I apologized for the mean things I had said in the fight. He didn't acknowledge it and when I tried speaking with him I'd be met with snarky commentary about how emotionally unstable I am. So I told him I'm not soending time with him until he apologizes or stops being a jackass.

Around the time I came home he sent me a message ""Are you done having a fit about everything I do wrong or are we still playing no talkies?"" And I told him that i said we can talk again once he apologizes. It's been radio silence since then.

I've sent him the usual morning messages today about have a nice day, hope you slept well and the likes. He's read them but is ignoring me. 

I know that not talking to him was my idea but I do miss him and I do miss spending time with him. I just want him to apologize which he probably never will, and now I'm the one suffering from my own choice. I just really need some advice on this because I just feel very lost and alone. I've apologized for my idiocy in the fight but I'm still being treated like the bad guy, despite hurtful things coming from his mouth."
123,"I (26F) did something when I was 20 that I've always regretted. Bar the other person involved, no one knows about this situation, even my best friends don't know and I have no intentions of telling them. Is it wrong to keep this thing a secret from my partner (28M)? 

On one hand, I feel like it will only hurt him if I tell him and he will judge me on something that I instantly regretted doing and on the other hand I worry about not being open with him and fear having any secrets in a relationship could be toxic.

What do ye think? I'd rather not say what the thing I did was but if needs be for context I'll try explain further in the comments"
124,"Mostly writing this vent/seek some outside advice.

About a year ago I started seriously weight-lifting, while I am an MMA practitioner. I was rather skinny because I was always weight-cutting for fights, and had never done any weight training, until one day this guy tells me he's a personal trainer and would like to work with me.

He charges, basically nothing. ( 200 bucks to train the whole month. ), versus other trainers who charge around 200 per ***Session***. And he's a great trainer, I've made some amazing gains with him training me. But ***GOLLY*** he's so ***TOXIC.*** it's ridiculous, almost every conversation we have is about how many women he has fucked, and how to get women by treating them with no respect, and his schemes for getting money and his future plans on how to scam some cash out of investors to open up his own business that he's sure will make him a millionaire. He also hates nerdy things, just the other day, he was telling me about how he took some corny nerd's girlfriend at the club and justified it by saying the guy was "" boring and deserved it. "" One time "" The Legend of Zelda "", puzzle-solving jiggle was playing in the gym and he just couldn't identify it, and when I told him that it was from "" The Legend Of Zelda,"" he says he doesn't like corny nerd shit.

Like. Are you kidding me?

It doesn't really affect me too much. But GOD is it draining. I'm coming back from Depression and it's so exhausting hearing him talk about the same thing over and over again. Do I like, talk to him about? Look for a new trainer? Train by myself? I'm open to suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My personal trainer's attitude makes me hate him a bit, suggestions?"
125,"There is a business that I visit on a regular basis and have to continue visiting for the foreseeable future for reasons I can't disclose for privacy. There is a girl there that I am insanely attracted to that I can't help but be flirty with. She has made it more than obvious that she's attracted to me as well. 

Herein lies the problem: I'm not in a good place in life. I moved across the country a few years ago for what was supposed to be my golden ticket to a better life. Things were going great at first, I was happier than I'd ever been, I dated more girls in year than I did in the decade prior. I was outgoing, charming, social, all the good things that come with being truly happy. It didn't last. My golden ticket turned out to be nothing more than a gilded turd and I've been miserable for the past 2 1/2 years. I've withdrawn from all social activity and broke contact with pretty much everybody, including my sister who was like my best friend. Basically I have been completely isolated this whole time. I haven't been taking care of myself, my eating habits are terrible, I've been using way too many drugs, and my overall health is at a low point. Basically, I'm am in the worst depression I've ever been in, and I have a history of clinical depression.

So with all that said, even though I would fucking love to see where things go with this girl, there is no way in hell I'm ready to bring somebody into my life like that. I couldn't even if I try. I'm not ready for the demands of even a friendship with another person, let alone a romantic relationship. It certainly wouldn't be fair to her to involve her in this mess that I am. 

I'm going to continue to see her, and I'm sure at some point in the very near future it is going to be expected of me to ask her out, or she will ask me. I think this is going to make things extremely awkward which I want to avoid at all costs. I have become completely socially inept and if things become awkward there I don't know how I will handle it. 

I feel like no matter what I do in this situation it'll make things very uncomfortable for me. If I course correct and stop flirting it'll confuse her and be awkward, or if she asks me out and I say no it'll be awkward. I don't even know if I can stop flirting with her because she's the first girl I've been attracted to in a long time, not to mention the fact that I know it's reciprocated. On top of that, whenever we have our flirty interactions it really puts me in a good mood, which is something I haven't experienced in a long while. The last time I saw her we didn't get to speak but she gave me the biggest smile of acknowledgement in a room full of people and it just made me feel so good. Like in that moment I wasn't this horrible piece of shit that I actually am. 

I don't know what to do here. It fucking sucks that I meet this perfect girl and there's nothing I can do about it because of where I am in life. And I'm not even ready to try to pick myself up out of this hole. I have become too comfortable in my misery and my effort tank is completely dry. 

I'm not asking for advice on how to get myself into a position where I am capable of dating. I'm asking for advice on how to continue seeing her without it being awkward. Her schedule seems to change at random so avoiding her won't work, and whether I keep flirting with her or not, it'll make for an awkward situation. Obviously I know I need to stop so I don't mess with her emotions, but how can I go full stop after letting it build up as much as I already have? 

I feel stupid for needing to come here for advice but here I am."
126,"The title is pretty self explanatory but there's a sort of background story to it. About four months ago, there was this music festival me and my family assisted. We enjoy partying and drinking soo it was a cool plan. I got very drunk (legal drinking age here is 18) but I felt safe because I was surround by my sisters and my BIL. We were all pretty drunk by the AM, and I started getting hungry. My BIL whom I had a great relation with and extreme confidence said he'd take me to get some food. As soon as we were away from my family's sight, he starts hugging me and getting closer. I'm pretty close to him and being drunk, I didn't noticed anything weird. That is, until he pulled to kiss me. I didn't push him away not expressed discomfort, because between being wasted and the shock, I really didn't know what to do.

Next morning we agreed that it had been wrong, I expressed regret and how we should never ever talk about it. I told him it made me uncomfortable, that it shouldn't have happened and that if I had been sober there was no chance I'd do something like that. He took it well. We were cool for a while.

That is until a month ago when he and my sister came home. They were staying in my room so I was getting some of my basic stuff out making way for them. He walks in and we chat a bit before he starts trying to get close to me. Now this raises a lit of red flags on my mind because we're both completely sober. There's no ""blame it on the alcohol"" here. I start pushing him away but his grip tightens and I start getting nervous. I try to play it all off as a joke and insist on leaving when he blocks the door. He grabs me by the waist and attempts to kiss me, to which I complete freak out and threaten him by saying I'll tell his wife (my sister) about it. He gets PISSED off and proceeded to ignore me for the rest of their visit.

However I broke down and told my other sister, who was furious. She said I had to speak up, but I didn't want to. I got super anxious at that. Noticing my reaction, she was lenient and told me she'd speak to our BIL in private and solve matters with him.

I thought she had forgotten about the incident because it was never mentioned again. However today I got two texts, one from my sister saying she's talking with him today, and one of my BIL asking me if there's anything wrong.

I have no idea what to do and anxiety is killing me. I'm scared this will blow up and cause a shitton of drama in my family. My sister and him have two kids (4 and 8) and I'd hate to take their dad away from them when I know first hand how hard is to grow up without a dad.  

My boyfriend insists I should tell my mom and that my whole family should know about him. Part of me wants to do that, but the other part of me is scared of consequences.

I thought I could ignore this and just carry on with my life normally but this confrontation is making me sick, and my sister and him are coming to visit next weekend which is high-key making me nervous too. I just don't know what to do and I'm so scared of what might happen on either case.

TL;DR My BIL has made inappropriate moves on me and idk if I should speak out (and if so, how?) Or not."
127,"We are going out for one month. She only hand one relationship that lasted 8 years (16-24). And she told me that she doesnt want to be in a relationship. And doesnt want labels Relationship, Exclusivity, Dating etc.What we have though has no difference between a relationship and she told me that she is in love with me. We talk all day everyday. We sleep together not just having sex. She is sweet she is kind and she is jealous. She is showing her affection. But she is afraid that she will end up again in a long lasting relationship and its sort of taboo to her. What should i do ?"
128,"Ok, well frankly, I dont really talk to anyone about it. I'm sure people can tell it's there, but still... I dont want to feel like a burden or needy and I am independent. Emotionally and financially.. (Maybe because I don't really have friends or date much) but anyways, every time I've even kinda opened up about ANYTHING personal, I usually scare them off. (And no, I dont just totally spill the beans out of nowhere lol..) This usually doesn't happen until we've been talking for weeks or perhaps months (rarely goes that far, though), so theres already a connection there.
My question.. should I just not really talk about this stuff? What do you guys expect out of someone in a relationship? I do work on myself, but there will be times when I barely function and I feel like my partner doesn't deserve that... in a way its turning me off dating all together. It makes me feel selfish."
129,"My(M 36) wife(F33) and I are in crisis. Or to state it more accurately, I feel like we’re in crisis. We’ve been together for 13 years, and sex has always been an issue. Her libido and interest in sex is well well below mine, and after years and years of trying to get her excited to have sex, I’ve given up. We’ve seen sex therapists, personal therapists, and nothing has changed- the really hard part is we’re super compatible in all other ways. We laugh every day, we enjoy each other, and have a mutual respect. A few months ago we got married and now I can’t seem to ignore the issue anymore. I just feel like I’m going to go the rest of my life not actively experiencing my own sexuality. On my therapists advice I shared this with her, and she said if it were up to her nothing would change. I feel panic! What do I do? We own a home together and a dog, is it really worth breaking up over sex??"
130,"So I'm (M 26) currently dating a woman(F 26) who comes from a somewhat conservative family.
 She herself is pretty modern and westernized.. here's some background info

 She currently lives at home and is working and attending school. Her family knows ABSOLUTELY nothing about me, Everytime we see each other she literally has to lie and pretend to be doing something else (work early, working late went to go study, call into work but says she's working etc). We only get to see each other for 1-3.5 hours max. I sometimes go downtown to see her on her lunch break too. She comes from a family where I wouldn't be accepted, because..

 1) They don't want her to date/they keep a very tight grip on her sense of freedom, because they don't want her to become ""used good/used up like a dirty tissue"". (they believe she's a virgin still... she lost her virginity years ago prior to this relationship)
2) I am not the same ethnicity/race as her, and her parent would have a problem with my race upon meeting/learning about me according to her.
3) They want her to marry someone of the same exact racial ethnicity and from the same place as her family.
4) We were both raised different forms of Christian(but still Christian), and her parents would ideally want her to be with someone that holds the SAME exact faith, regardless as to if it's the same religion.
5) I don't have my bachelor's degree.. yet. I currently have my associates and I work in a career field that I've established myself in by working immensely hard, that normally requires degrees (Advertising and Marketing) and pays really well. I have a ton of verifiable experience that could easily find me further work. To her family (and some extent, her) that means nothing and a higher degree is all that matters to prove I could provide and hypothetically support a family.. I intend to go back to school for my BBA and MBA, but in order to get married/propose, she would want me to ask for her parents permission and in order to do that I would have to have a degree, so that's ""a requirement"" almost if I want to marry her
5) They probably wouldn't accept her being in a relationship and would want to pick her significant other/husband. A few years back when they found out she had a boyfriend they made her literally LEAVE her University (that SHE was paying for) and work/enroll in online college. She was a legal adult, but living under their roof and cares about their perception and quotient want to seem ungrateful for the sacrifices they've made earlier in her life, so she obliged.. this has frankly hindered her current level of success, considering she'd have her degree by now and her University costs were much cheaper than her current online college... Plus she she still owes on loans from that other school age left.

Now that the background information is out of the way, here we go...

We were on the phone speaking last night about not living together before marriage (which I'm 89% ok with right now) and the subject of her eventually getting an apartment and having her own place came up (I currently own my own home). I expressed not being able to wait until she can come over and I could wake up next to her beauty, and can't wait till she can actually fall asleep in my arms, regardless of who's spot we're at.. etc. She then proceeded to tell me that she ""wouldn't do sleepovers until Marriage because she only wants to wake up next to her husband"".. frankly this makes no sense to me considering we are currently engaging in sexual intercourse and she said ""we can fall asleep during the day (which we have before) just not at night and spend the night"". It's not a faith/religious thing and it's not a sex thing, so can someone help me understand this?
Am I justified for being upset by this notion?
 I explained to her that I'm already gonna have to wait at a MINIMUM, 2 more years to get engaged to her so I can get my degree in order to propose to her, and then on top of that planning a wedding properly, takes time (I'm perfectly ok with going to Vegas or some bullshit, because the only thing that matters is our unity and becoming one, as well as my love for her.. she wants the ceremony/reception andv all that) and that I wouldn't be willing to wait that long JUST to fall asleep with her by my side because her presence means everything to me and conceptually her reason as to why makes no sense to me. Am I wrong?"
131,"Hey guys, 

I’ve been having trouble trying to figure out why my relationship feels more like two bros with benefits. 

I (24 F) started liking my boyfriend (19 M) after we went on a few cycling/ camping trips together in the summer. He told me he had feelings for me during one of those trips, but I didn’t feel the same way just because his age was throwing me off. I’ve never dated anyone younger before, and he was about to enter university while I’m going to be graduating. 
I eventually gave in because we had a lot of things in common, and he’s an overall fun person. 

Things started out great like any honeymoon stage, but it has always felt more like we’re two good friends with benefits. I consider myself a cheesy and openly affectionate person, but I don’t feel much affection or see any signs that he really likes me/ treats me as more than a friend besides the sex. It’s his first relationship, and this is my sixth relationship so I can’t tell if he’s just inexperienced or there’s something wrong with my perception of what we are. He says he really likes me a lot, but there aren’t many hugs, kisses, initiations to hang out or talk, saying affectionate things towards me, etc. 

I’ve brought it up to him before, but we can’t seem to work out a solution. 

TLDR:my bf (19M) and I (24 F) have been together for almost five months, but I still don’t feel like a girlfriend. Told him already, but it seems to not make any difference. 

Was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to remedy this issue or what I can say or do ? Has anyone felt this way before?"
132,"About two months ago, this guy that I’ve been talking to and been pretty into for over a year told me that he loved me in bed one night as we were falling asleep. Sex was not involved that night just for the record. Naturally I was ecstatic. I thought we were finally heading toward the same page, but I never asked for clarity because I was so lost in that high. 

Over the next month and half we had such a wonderful time, part of which included sending each other more frequent nudes over Snapchat. One night I got a little daring and actually put my face in one. He ended up taking a screenshot of it. He said he really liked it and asked if it was okay that he did that, to which I said yes. I remember being a little anxious at the time, but I pushed it down. 

After about a month and a half, after a couple sour nights of drinking, things kinda took a poor turn, but not exactly the end of all things. About two weeks later, I finally got the courage to ask, hey—what are we? To which I really got no clear answer from him. I always knew he wasn’t my “boyfriend” (I just use that here to simplify things a bit) because it was never said explicitly, but we acted so much like it, the title just as well might have been. 

Anyway, he said he loved me as more than just a friend—and that was about as close to anything I got beyond the reality that he doesn’t consider us to actually be anything “label”-wise. I’ve asked him to think more about what he wants from me, because I want something commitment like with him, and the limbo of spending four nights a week at his house and emotionally investing myself into him more than I already was is beginning to weigh me down.

Last night, I asked him for two things. One was some more of the money he owed me for helping him get his car fixed three months ago (he’s not well off with money, but he’s made no initiative himself to pay me back other than the one time I asked him about a month ago), and the second was that he delete or remove my face from that nude screenshot. I explained that I had been okay with him having it originally because I thought he and I were actually something. The more I learned that that wasn’t the case for him (either not in this moment or ever) I was no longer comfortable that that picture existed. 

After that second request, he got a little curt and immediately went to bed, refusing to answer any of my texts save for one. I made a comment that it kinda hurt that he couldn’t even say good night or love you like he’d been doing, to which he just insulted me by saying everything seems to kinda hurt me, which actually really did hurt me to realize he cares so little about my feelings. 

So, my main question here—was I wrong to ask for those things last night—specifically that he delete the picture? How do I fix this situation. 

Tl;dr: Turns out my BF isn’t my BF. I asked him to delete a nude photo of me with my face in it—he now seems to want nothing to do with me. Was I wrong to ask that? How do I turn the situation around?"
133,"So my mom has always made a big deal of holidays, especially Christmas and Birthdays. For this reason, I am used to being spoiled on my ""special day"" and I love doing the same for my friends and family. My boyfriend, however, grew up in a family that did not celebrate birthdays and don't really do ""gifts"".

My bf and I have been together for 5 years, and I always make a fuss over his birthdays. Whether its a weekend vacation, a concert or music festival tickets, etc. I have always spent upwards of $500-600 on his birthday (with dinner, hotel, etc.). However, he never makes a big deal out of my birthday. I know my mom starts planning my birthdays months in advanced and has these grand ideas that she shares with him, but he still makes no effort. So last year, after making him dinner, taking him out for a weekend, buying him concert tickets for his favourite artist, and paying for drinks at the concert, I was looking forward to my upcoming birthday to see what he would do to celebrate! I should also add that when he asks me for gifts, I don't recommend specifics because I like surprises. It doesn't have to be a grand gift, just something to show that you know me and know what I like. 

Well... my birthday rolls around and he buys me a lemon zester. Yes, a lemon zester.. like the $5 ones from the grocery store. No surprise, no birthday dinner, not even a card. Like this lemon zester was just in its cardboard packaging. I mean, yes I love cooking but good God I go to great lengths to plan his birthdays and he buys something that he probably saw on the morning of my birthday while grabbing milk for breakfast. I never brought it up to him but its been eating away at me for almost a year now. His birthday is coming up in December and I don't want to spend all my time and money planing an event knowing he doesn't do the same for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being overly sensitive and materialistic or are my feelings justified? Pls help. 

And if I'm going to bring it up to him, how do I not hurt his feelings? I'm not trying to be ungrateful I just feel unappreciated."
134,"It would be weird and creepy if I came up to her after so many years of never talking with her and confessed my feelings out of nowhere, wouldn't it? ^(And she's constantly surrounded by others who have crush on her, so the rumor would spread everywhere like wildfire.)

I mean, it still will be creepy even if I send her a message, but I won't have to look her in face that way... What's more, maybe if I ask her to not say it to anyone, she won't. ^(Well, except her boyfriend, maybe.)

And yes, I'm spineless coward and have no balls.

But, to be honest, I think I would rather be flat-out rejected than bottle up my feelings and think ""what could have been"" 20 years from now on."
135,"Hi relationship_advice. I’m on mobile, lurker, yadayadayada. 

I am a college student studying software engineering. I have college friends of all financial backgrounds and different majors who I have met working various minimum-wage on-campus jobs. Recently I had my first internship in engineering and the pay rate, in comparison to my minimum wage jobs, is, frankly, stupid money to me. 

The vast, vast majority of my income I put into savings, car payments and paying off student debt, but the hike in cash for me means I have a bit of money to spend. I don’t really have any like, expensive hobbies or interests (I wear my thrifted clothes till they fall apart, don’t purchase makeup often, hobbies are “free” things like jogging or taking photos with my dad’s handmedown camera)

However, I have been wanting to try some fancier restaurants in my college town. I’m not talking about going to the nines or anything, but it would be nice to get a change of pace from the 59 cent Del Taco deals on Tuesdays that have so frequently been a part of my life. I’m talking about going somewhere where the average meal is maybe like $20 but the bill could add up with a fancy drink or are shared appetizer. Somewhere where I would feel obligated to change out of my ratty sweatpants. 

The thing is, I want to go do this with some of my closest friends, and a lot of them simply don’t have the budget to go get silly food for no specific occasion. But with the money I have made I would be totally happy to buy the one or two of my friends I go out with dinner just so I can have their lovely company and we can try a wacky restaurant out. 

I tried doing this with a friend of mine but she clearly felt awkward and perused the menu until she found the cheapest meal possible. Then she thanked me like fifty times and clearly felt a bit weird. I don’t want her to feel awkward or feel like she “owes” me something, but it felt like when I tried to reassure her she just felt worse...

How do I navigate the awkwardness of financial situations? The world seems increasingly unfair now that I feel literally bankrolled with my part-time internship while my film-major friends will work a 30-hour weekend on set completely unpaid to boost their resumes. 

My parents will hang out with their adult friends and they grab the bill all the time and it isn’t weird or awkward. I think a lot of it is because we are quite young and not used to anything but the glory of Del Taco (I am in no way dissing DT—they’ve gotten me through rough times)

So, uh, help? What’s a good way to invite a friend out but clarify they don’t have to worry about the bill in a way that wouldn’t make them uncomfortable?"
136,"Hi,

I've been dating someone \[28F\] for three months and everything was going great until recently. When I met her she was really busy and always going out of town to see close friends that live 2 hours away or going on group trips even further away with her friends group. She use to live someone else and her best friends still live 2+ hours away from the city we live in. 

For the first three months this never bothered me, but now we're talking about getting more serious. Last week she shared a calendar with me and for the rest of the year every weekend is booked up. I'm joining her this next weekend on a group trip and we won't even have a private place to sleep together... just on an air mattress or something. It will be her plus a ton of her friends and me. 

I'm an introvert and this is kind of a big thing for me and a big event. She's extroverted and this is normal.

The weekend after that we are spending a Saturday night/Sunday together for the first time. She has one really close girlfriend and they are constantly in touch with each other making plans all of the time and there is no way I can keep up. 

We talked about all of this last week and she said that as her pre-commitments finish she will of course consider me and make space and time for me. So I was feeling resolved and reassured that that is the case. During that conversation she also mentioned that one example of making space for me is that I could come join her for a night while she's at a weekend event/conference in a nearby city. I thought that was a good idea, I could meet her, and we'd spend the night together, then I'd go on Sunday. I mentioned a hotel and she was interested. Sounds perfect! Then the other night she told me her closest friend might want to hang out in the city, and her enthusiasm about a hotel was much less... and now I just feel like its not about us but more about her and her friend even though we had a conversation about it being about us a week ago. They're going on a 4-day weekend trip together the very weekend before, too. And the rest of the year is all group events! I don't think it's too controlling or unreasonable for me to want to time alone together outside of weeknights if we're going to have a more serious relationship. 

The thing is I don't even think we'd be having this conversation if her friends lived in the same city as us. I really am supportive of independent lives but when someones live is not even in the same city how do I handle that? Traveling out of town each weekend to see friends just cuts into so much available time we could share, and I don't want to just be in a weeknight relationship."
137,"I don't know why I am having these thoughts and I hate that I'm having them and I can't get in to see my therapist and I can't sort through this myself.... My partner is perfect, he is everything that I have ever wanted and he makes me so incredibly happy and I love him so much. But I have been struggling with thoughts of breaking up with him. I was diagnosed with BPD at the end of last year around the same time my partner and I began our relationship and I have been regularly seeing my therapist since mid last year. While I struggled with intrusive thoughts in the beginning of our relationship like ""What if I don't really love him? What if I'm too much hard wor and he leaves?"" Kind deal but after a while these thoughts settled and I felt secure and positive in our future. Until his parents told him to break up with me. He is asian and his parents are very traditional and his father is abusive and controlling over his family. I once saw the man beat his daughter over not getting him a second bowl of soup immediately while I was visitting. Which was awful and incredibly triggering for me and made me fear for my partners safety when I wasn't around. Anyway, his parents became convinced thAT MY FAMILY WERE IN A GANG, because I offhandedly told his mother how proud I was of my mother for getting her motorcycle liscense despite her fear and then SIX MONTHS LATER his father decides after weeks of telling my partner awful things about me, like, that I only come over to dinner THAT THEY INVITE ME FOR to get free food and I'm dangerous because I do MMA, his father decides to tell my partner he either has to break up with me or lose his job at the family restaurant and be forced out of home. We worked through that through the help of a family friend to help solve things with his parents and to assure them that no, my family was not in a gang just because they liked motorcycles and their accusations of my character were uncalled for. That was that. My partner and therapist pushed me to spend time away from his place to recover from what happened because the last time I was there I was too stressed out and made for awkward conversation. His mother cried and hugged me and apologised to me for what had happened so thats something... Since then, I haven't felt secure in my relationship and I have been having doubts... It hurt me to see how badly the man I love was impacted by this and I out my full attention to supporting him through it, but U couldn't help but feel that it was my fault it happened because I'm not really a very traditional woman myself... I was angry that it happened and I felt he would be better off with another girl, but I didn't want him tk be with another girl, I wanted him to be with ME. I feel so awful about what had happened and I'm struggling to get through it and I am ANGRY. I am angry that it happened and I'm angry that our plans together are on hold because his parents don't want him to move in with me... I'm angry that they have the power to control our relationship, they constantly get in the way of us and it doesn't help that he still lives at home which i can't stand, they're abusive and controlling and he and his siblings still live there as adults. I understand its culture as well but I can't help but get frustrated by all this... I feel so insecure and betrayed in my relationship because of whats happened and I know, its not fair to blame him for it either but I just wish he was more independent... Now that I'm typing it out it seems pretty clear why I have been havung thoughts about breaking up with him... I won't lie when I say I have also been thinking about dating someone else or just being by myself because I worry that this relationship isn't right for me or maybe I'm just meant to be alone because I'm mentally ill... I don't WANT to break up but at this point I can't tell if these are the intrusive thoughts my therapist and I have been working through or reality.. When I spoke to my trusted friends and my mother, they all said that these doubts are all normal in a long term relationship and that its valid that I would feel this after what we went through together... They say they think we are perfect for eachother and my fellow BPD friend told me about her experiences with her own partner and that made me feel less alone... I don't want to break up with him but I'm struggling to get through what happend and I am angry that all of our plans for our future are put on hold because of something out of our control and I just feel like I can't trust him on what he wants from us because I was really excited and happy when we were planning to move in together and I was so sure of us and what we wanted and how I felt but now I'm not and I'm just angry and rejected...Now, I get upset whenever he doesn't reply to my texts because I get convinced he's gonna leave me... And I know breaking up is the easy way to do things and I don't want that, I just want to get through these feelings... He is everything I have ever wanted and I don't think I could cope with him leaving and he makes me so happy and I feel so guilty for feeling this way and I wish someone could just tell me how I feel and tell me what to do...

TLDR: Thinking of breaking with my perfect long term partner after his parents told him to break up with me or lose his family because they thought my family was in a gang because they like motorcycles and now our future plans are on hold and I feel incredibly insecure..."
138,"This is a little different from most posts here, I hope it fits.

I've been going to the same barbershop for about five years.  There are usually three or four barbers working at any one time.  The setup is generally that whichever barber is available cuts the next customer's hair.  This is fine with me because I have an uncomplicated haircut.  Some customers do have a specific barber they wait for though.

A new barber (Jim) has been working there for about six months, and he has been the one to do my last five haircuts.  I've become increasingly dissatisfied with Jim's cuts.  The last one was the worst and I don't want him to cut my hair anymore.  I also find his preset tip options on his Square app laughable (30, 40, and 50 percent) but that's beside the point.

I guess the easy answer is to just say ""I'd prefer to wait for someone else"" if he's the one available next time I go, but that's a little awkward as I don't have a history of preferring someone, and it would be clear that I'm literally asking for anyone but him.  I'm fine doing that, since I prefer a good haircut to a little awkwardness, but I was wondering if people had thoughts on better ways to phrase things or approach this?"
139,"Hi all,

I'm having trouble understanding the feelings I have towards my girlfriend. We have been going out for about 7 months, she is from South America and i've gone for 2 weeks with her to be with her family. We've moved pretty fast and she's  moving in with me now and next year we will be looking for a new place for us. I love her, but I am confused.

My issue is I have crazy lustful feelings for other  women (as a note I will NEVER cheat on her). I can't help looking at other women, and I feel like a dirtbag about it. I have thoughts of being with other people that I can't shake out of my head. I love her but at the same time I feel like i'm looking for something less commited. I don't know what I should do! I feel like I should not be in a relationship with her but we've done so much together and it would devestate her I know. I don't want to be completely selfish, but I feel like I will end up hurting her even more :(

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

(My other account got suspended, why I am using a new one!)"
140,"I (22F) just broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of 2 years. 

We live together. We had a really good talk, and he asked me if it was what I wanted, and if it would be better for me, he’ll do it. 
We ate dinner together, cried a few times, and cuddled until we fell asleep. I move our Monday. I told him we can’t do this cuddling this anymore, the “I love you” because it will make things harder, but he keeps saying he wants to spend as much time with as possible before he goes home (he’s from a different state and if moving back in with his parents).

After last night, I see how much he loves me, how much he cares and how his life isn’t going to be happy after. His home life will be terrible but I think he needs to do it. He needs to go back to school, needs to improve his credit and financial stuff. He needs to mature. 

I’m having second thoughts, he was so loving last night, and when it comes down to it he loves me and what happens if I’m making the wrong choice breaking up with him? Should I stay? Should I go? What happens if after he leaves I realize I fucked up and he’s like my soul mate or some shit? What if when he goes home he’s super sad. 

TLDR; I broke up with my boyfriend and now I’m having second thoughts."
141,"So my girlfriend and I have been in our relationship about 11 months. We see each other on about a weekly basis as she lives about an hour and a half away. Things are mostly good but sometimes we get in arguments over mostly stupid things and it always seems to be me making the effort to actually fix things and fight for her back. We'll call her J. So recently, I got a new bike from a friend and was pretty excited about it because I've never had a bike before. J goes to school from about 7am - 3:00pm since she's in university, so this is usually time where I'm at home not doing much if I'm not working, this is typically when I game and do stuff alone since she's at school. I mentioned to J that I wanted to go bike riding for about half an hour while she was at school and she got really passive aggressive, saying things like ""ok I guess."" I asked her straight up if she was okay with me going and she said no, to which I said okay. I asked her why she said no because I genuinely wanted to hear why she would have an issue with me going out alone to bike ride in my neighborhood for half an hour while she's not around. She then proceeded to freak out on me, saying ""no should be enough"" ""why do you need an explanation? If you need an explanation go be single."" I explained to her that I wasn't contesting her saying no, I just wanted to know why so I could understand why she had an issue with it. She proceeded to go off on me further saying ""you promised me saying no would be enough. I'm done, go be single."" I replied that she also promised she would communicate with me, and asked why that promise is disregarded because it's convenient for her to be upset at me. Now she's not talking to me and I've sat here trying to text and call her on every platform available. What can I do to address the micromanagement she does, as this isn't the first time something like this has happened. What can I do about trying to ease her into actually communicating with me instead of saying things like ""no should be enough."""
142,"I recently just lost a future boyfriend after he seen me without makeup. We weren’t in a relationship but we were going to be until he saw me without makeup. Growing up in high school, I wore makeup when I took pictures for Facebook and I didn't have on my glasses. I never wore makeup to school. Most people at school would call me ""catfish."" They would comment on my pics ""this looks nothing like you."" Even my some of my family members would say some stuff like that to me. 4+ years later. Im in college now. I have been told I look just like my pictures. I wear makeup everyday, everywhere. I wear a lot of makeup. Foundation, concealer, powder and mascara. I get treated different when I do wear makeup than on days I don’t. I feel like I have to wear makeup everyday just to get respected. I don’t know how ugly I am without but I must be really ugly."
143,"My father is a pedophile and child molester. He molested my sister several times over several years whilst physically and emotionally abusing my family members. He is the pure definition of evil, disgusting and sinful. He is the one person on this earth who I can truely and honestly say that I can completely and utterly despise and hate. He served a disgustingly short sentence and still has no comprehension of what he did wrong and how it has affected us. Basically I have no faith in the justice system or in the world because he is living a happy life and we are all still struggling with this. He was removed from my life at 5 years old, I have fewer memories of him than I have fingers. But in that amount of time it is believed that he was grooming me as much as it disgusts me to say. He exhibited severe favouritism, possessiveness and took me to shower with him; and has since wrote what I perceive to be inappropriate things in cards. I struggle to cope with this all and frequently have disturbing dreams pertaining to him, but I don’t feel like I have to right to say he has affected me because I haven’t been abused like my siblings and was probably saved from a similar fate. I’m at a deep internal conflict within my own morals because he disgusts me but I just want to know what it would be like if I had a dad or if I contacted him. I know for certain is it would give him satisfaction and me eternal fear and regret no matter what. Like what if he died and I would never know. I know I’m a terrible bad and disgusting person because I even think of it but I just don’t know. I also struggle with interacting with older men, I always feel uncomfortable and can’t talk or make eye contact. At the same time and probably because of this, I have a need for validation from them either in my appearance or intelligence.. I don’t know why, I just do. It’s so fucked up. I just want someone to tell me the right answer, what to do, because it’s been bothering me for a long time and I am afraid it’s going to haunt me forever.

+ sorry for the shitty alt username"
144,"I’m struggling right now I asked this girl out a while ago and she said yes. Well recently I have had some shit come up and am just super nervous around her, and she has noticed. I don’t know what to do, I’ve always been a more shy type but I can’t think of how to break it what should I do?"
145,"We were together for 11 months. We're both university students from Brazil, met on tinder and fell in love in a couple of weeks. On our first date we chatted for like 4 hours until the restaurant closed, on the following couple of weeks we met at least 6 times and eventually deleted tinder together. After one month I asked her to be my gf, which she accepted.
In August we went on a 20 days trip to Europe (Paris, Amsterdam and London), it was a dream, everything was perfect, no fights at all. We had a lot of intimacy, I felt like it was going to last forever, and so did she (she said it).
Then 2 weeks ago she came to my house crying, saying she's feeling guilty for not being the girlfriend I deserved, for not loving me like she was supposed to, for not wanting to kiss and have sex. She asked for a time, to be alone and to think on what's wrong, without being around me to feel guilty anymore.
It hit me like a truck, I was devastated. She was my first girlfriend, my best friend and the person which I could always be honest and share my feelings.
She was always saying that she loves me but don't want to hurt my feelings, saying that we don't know the future, we can still be together, have kids and grow old, etc.
She also said that it was nothing to do with me, that I was the best bf she ever had (I was the 3rd), which I believe. I have a good relationship with her mother and she told me the same thing, they both talked alot about it and that she (my gf) was devastated, that she liked me, that she cant complain about anything, but she's not certain about her feelings anymore. 

My gf has depression and takes medication btw. I really think that this has something to do with it, even taking her medication, but honestly idk what to believe anymore.

What do you guys think is going on?"
146,"I am newly dating someone. He doesn’t seem to weigh our actions in the same way. We don’t text very much throughout the day, but if I were to stop texting back he would ask about where I was or what I was doing. I normally update him if I’m going to be gone for a couple hours (like out with my friends, etc.), so this doesn’t happen often but it has before. He, on the other hand, disappears sometimes with no notice and will get back to me later telling me what he was doing. We did talk about this and I told him if he knew he was going to be MIA for a while then to maybe just send me a quick message saying he’s gonna be busy! We have gotten better about this overall.

However, yesterday I had a very bad day. I told him about this. It involved a lot of emotions brought up from my past that I had not encountered for a while, so I didn’t really know how to talk about them to him. On top of that, he and I were supposed to spend the night together but he made overlapping plans with his parents, so we couldn’t see each other. At the end of the night, very late, I did try to explain my feelings to him, since he asked me what was wrong. I sent him multiple paragraph long texts about what I had been thinking and feeling. He responded rather shortly to only one part of my many messages. He eventually just said I should seek therapy for my issues. I told him (not for the first time) how that was difficult for me right now financially, but he just said the same thing again. 

At that point I realized not much good was going to come of continuing to talk like this. It was around 11 pm at this point and I’d been up since 5 am for work, so amongst all the emotional stuff I was experiencing I was also just tired. I sent him an admittedly abrupt message saying “Well, hey, I’m going to go to bed. I hope you have a good night” 

Apparently that was the wrong thing to do? I locked my phone and didn’t look at it again, and went to sleep. When I woke up, he had said: “Why do I feel like I did something wrong?” Then “Seriously?” Followed by “Okay, whatever” all of those came in shortly after I said I was going to bed. This morning, I got the curtest “Good morning” ever. I asked why he was upset with me now for having a bad night? He said he didn’t like the way I handled things last night. I told him that the night seemed like a wash and that I was tired and upset and wanted to sleep. He continued sending very clearly angry messages to me saying I shouldn’t have just dipped out like that after “making (him) feel like it was his fault.” I told him I didn’t appreciate him making my bad night into something somehow against him and making me feel bad for it, like I had done something wrong by having a bad night?

He said that I did in fact do something wrong, and that he’s “allowed” to be upset at how I handled things. I said fine but that I’m also “allowed” to be not okay with how this was going. He told me I was just interested in fighting about his reaction. Honestly, idk what to say to him right now. Since writing this post, he’s texted me multiple times asking if I’m just going to ignore him and then “fine, I need to get back to work anyways.” 

What can I even say? I already explained to him prior to today as well as today that sometimes when I have a bad day that feels like it can’t be fixed any more, I’ll just go to sleep because then I at least can wake up in a new day that is hopefully not the same as the previous. I’ll admit that I was less than my usual peppy self last night when I said goodnight, normally I do send him a sweet message, but idk I don’t think how I handled it was horrible? I’m just so confused and really have no idea what to say to him."
147,"My fiancé and I have been having issues as of lately. Long story short, we both betrayed each others trust while having a LDR. He made a mistake about a year ago today, I found out about it early this year and decided to seek petty revenge. 

We both came together and decided that we wanted to start fresh and be on the same page. It's been difficult because of the hurt feelings and mistrust on both sides. 

He moved to my state a few months ago and we've been living together for a few months now. Things have been incredible. He's been a man of his word and has respected me. He has done legit everything for me without me ever asking. He treats me incredibly well and I love him. 

I've noticed that I've been paranoid about him betraying me again, to the point where I go behind his back and snoop through his things. Although I never find anything, I still drive myself insane with doubt. I hate it.

He's noticed it and we had an talk about it last night. Basically he feels like I don't appreciate him because after everything he's done for me I still can't trust him. Which I've noticed it too. I've become a spoiled brat and have been taking instead of giving. 

He doesn't want anything to change between us but he wants me to be happy and to appreciate what he does for me.

I try to show him that anyway I can, it's difficult when he does everything for me and when I ask if I can help he says no. I told him I'm confused about what he expects because he wants my help but will tell me otherwise. 

I'm terrified that I'll stand in my own way and mess this relationship up. I'm not used to people being genuinely loving to me. I come from a extremely abusive background and I get scared that people will hurt me. 

What can I do to stop feeding those negative thoughts and show him I love and appreciate all he does for me? 

I know know he's genuine with his feelings and he is remorseful for his past mistake, but I can't seem to get out of my own head."
148,"So i was I was in line with one of my friends, let's call him fish, and he passes me a small paper with the words ""can I have your number?"" Since I had an underclassmen with me I was awkward about it and didn't know how to respond so I just awkwardly stared at him for a few seconds. Well, after this, fish's friend jumped in and said ""oh, that was for me, but I gave it to him and told him to pass it on"" so I passed the paper on to another of my friends... In front of him... And he quickly looked at me, then looked away and started talking to his friend. I know this isn't a lot of info but its been bothering me since Friday and havent seen him since, am looking for him to ask but just need to know if I'm an idiot that doesn't pick up on this type of stuff lol"
149,"My boyfriend (30M) fell into a depression pit and I don't know how to help. 
He quit his dead-end job last year to do some personal work which backfired as he wasn't able to get it off the ground. So he quit. 

He's been passively looking for work since June this year and it's been driving me nuts that I'm working and all of a sudden I have to support someone else on my income. 

Hit me with the advice, people. In dire need of it."
150,"First of all sorry if there are spelling/grammar mistakes, english isn’t my first language. And throwaway account
Anyway:
We’re more than 2 years in a relationship now, moved together very quick and have never had a day not seeing each other since then. 
She was always a very overreacting, emotional and jealous girl but things getting out of hand lately. 
A few months ago we got us a puppy and I am totally in love with this little dog. Spending most of the time with him going for a walk or playing, because that are things a little dog needs to do and I’m the only one really taking care of him. She’s working quite often and I’m home, doing household and working a bit in my home office.

So first time she got pretty angry was when I asked her to go out with the dog after she came home that I can take a shower and maybe calm down for a few seconds. (For those who don’t know a puppy is like a baby)
She said she was tired from work, hungry and wanted to watch tv and how dare I staying the whole day home asking her to go for a walk. 
Not wanting to start a fight I said (a little bit passive aggressive) that although it’s OUR dog it is ok and she should chill. She started to yell at me what an asshole I am and screaming that it hurts her feelings. I don’t like to fight so I just stayed cool and told her my opinions like that I’m too working at home and taking care of the dog and doing the household etc. but she’s getting even angrier.
So angry she hit me in the face.. dog super afraid, me super confused. She immediately said she was sorry she did this and so the fight ended. 
A few days later similar incident. 
This whole shit is going of for several months now. Her punches don’t really hurt so I’m not complaining about getting hurt, but I start getting angry that she touches me that way. Like If I did this she’d call the police or shit. 

I talked to her saying this is not what I want a relationship to be and she said she will start working on that, but I really can’t trust her at this time anymore. Of course I still love her so don’t want to end things (I guess). I really don’t know what to do in this situation. Any help from you is appreciated!

TL;DR
My girlfriend startet to beat me when we got a puppy, it doesn’t hurt but now I have trust issues"
151,"My ex and I met in March and started dating in June. We made it official in August and last month he broke up with me. He got fired from his job, then said that he needed time, started to ghost me for a week until I finally made him talk to me and he ended things through a text message. I tried to talk to him on social media (Instagram, FB) because I was worried about how he was (the job thing, also he had some family issues) but he blocked me everywhere.

A couple of days ago, I signed up on Tinder and saw him. I swiped right and he did too. He told me through the chat that we wanted to meet in person to discuss how things ended between us. That he's very sorry for making me feel like that, that he got scared because he's jobless and also because he started to really really like me and got scared. He said he felt he wasn't ready for a relationship (he's never been in one before, I was his first serious girlfriend) and that he has lots of doubts.

BUT he also matched with a friend of mine on Tinder (he didn't know she is a friend of mine) and she asked him about me, and he said that he ended things because he felt that something wasn't right and that he didn't see a future with me. 

Anyway, I know he's lying someway but I kinda know which one of his statements is true. I don't know if I should meet him in person... I don't know what could I expect.

Also, it kinda hurts to know that he didn't see a future with me. Now I feel that nobody could see a future with me, in the long run, and I don't know why."
152,"I know of an affair occurring between two coworkers (who I will call Tom and Sarah), one of whom has a girlfriend (who I will call Lisa). Lisa is very sweet and have meet her once or twice. My coworker and Lisa are in a very serious long term relationship and \*annoyingly\* likes to share on social media how much he loves her when it's well known at the office he's cheating on her. On several work outtings, Tom and Sarah (the other co-worker) are openly flirtatious and always leaves together. My friend/ coworker who is closer to Tom also has texts of him admitting to cheating on his girlfriend with Sarah, but still claiming he loves her (the girlfriend).

As someone in a committed relationship, I feel like if I was in the girlfriend's position, I would want to know now that my boyfriend is cheating on me sooner than later, like when I'm married. 

My friends have told me that it's none of my business. My own boyfriend has told me it's none of my business. This is all reminding me of a ""What Would You Do?"" episode where no-one really wants to do anything about a situation so blatantly uncomfortable because it's none of their business. I'm wondering what you would do in my situation, and whether anonymously messaging the girlfriend is too far-fetched?"
153,My boyfriend broke up with me a week ago and I haven’t been bothering him or talking to him at all. I’ve just apologized a lot the first day and am now giving him space. We got in a fight that resulted in him breaking up with me. Obviously arguing to the point of this isn’t healthy but we haven’t argued much in the past. He told me he still loves me and I know he still cares about me. He gave me money to help pay for bills and brought me food the other day when he came to drop my things off to me and I didn’t ask for any of that. When I told him I’d pay him back when I could he told me absolutely not and if I needed anything to reach out to him. I want to get back together with him eventually no matter the amount of time it’d take to mend our relationship but I also know there’s a good chance that’ll never happen. Curious if anyone thinks I have a chance still?
154,"I bake cupcakes &amp; cakes, not professionally, but my cupcakes are professional quality if that makes sense. I've been paid a few times in the past but for the most part it's just a way for me to give a gift that is personal. It's sort of my ""thing"" and over the years I've had a lot of fun with the hobby and gotten pretty skilled. I usually make them for special occasions, so when she got engaged I made some cupcakes for her and brought them over to celebrate. 



Well she loves them, and she immediately started asking if I could make a few for her wedding. I said yes because I was thinking that she'd want 2-3 dozen the way she described it, and being a broke college student who works full-time I figured that that would be a nice substitution for a gift. but now she's talking about wanting close to 120 cupcakes! Not only as this financially impossible for me to manage right now (remember, I'm not a professional, so it's not like I buy these things in bulk), but the cupcakes that I make take quite a while. It's one thing to mix batter and put the cupcakes in the oven, but I hand make my frosting. We're talking 3-5 minutes per cupcake, multiple batches of frosting for specialty colors, etc. I really worked hard on these cupcakes because I thought it would be a fun thing to show her that I care and to celebrate, but now I feel like I'm on the hook for something that would be worth hundreds of dollars. 



Like I said, if I was in a position where I was financially stable I wouldn't hesitate to do it. It's just that my schedule is so busy, and I've expressed that I'm tight for cash before, so I am sort of upset that she didn't offer to pay me to begin with. She's in a much more financially secure place than I am and while I dont struggle to pay bills it feels like she should care enough to pay me if that makes sense. I just don't want to rock the boat too much because I do appreciate her as a friend (I wouldn't make these for anybody) but she doesn't take confrontation well and I'm nervous to try to ask. Any advice appreciated!"
155,"We've been together since around December 2017. We used to do long (50km) distance for a while, but she moved closer to study here. Both of us go to college and we work part-time. The problem started when she moved in and we began seeing each other every day. Now, I like gaming a lot. I enjoy trophy hunting in Playstation games and used to spend a lot of my free time playing when she was away. Now that she moved to my place however, I lowered my gaming time to a minimum, not earning a single platinum trophy in 2 months. This isn't enough for her though, since she wants attention from me constantly while I'm a pretty quiet guy that enjoys his silence and free space. I could let that slide and play exclusively while she isn't home, but recently she started getting annoyed at me playing guitar and bass (which are an integral part of me at this point), when I should be doing stuff with her. She doesn't seem to understand that I need to wind down at the end of the day after school and work, while I barely utilize ""me time"" on the weekends where we go out, or go on bike rides together. Are we just not compatible? I'm not expecting to find my soulmate at this point in my life, but I really enjoy her company and wouldn't want to break up over something as trivial as an hour or two spent on myself."
156,"To be clear from the get-go, he doesn't lie about important stuff. Or at least not things I think are really important. The thing is, he keeps lying about the most mundane stuff ever. Like, he will change his opinion on a song depending on who's there, or lies about something that happened to him (maybe not lying, but embellishing details and such). I have been noticing this for a few years now and it doesn't seem to change. A few times I have confronted him about it, sometimes more subtle than others. 

It's getting to be really annoying (or frustrating), because he's one of my best friends and I really love him (as a friend, obviously) but it's getting to the point where I don't trust him to tell me his real opinion about something, especially when I have noticed a few times my own opinion being parroted back to me. Also, I feel like he might be really insecure, and I would like to help him with that if I could.

Is there a way to solve this without him getting hurt? Or him denying everything? 

I am not the nicest/most tactful person so he might think I am attacking him when that really isn't my intention."
157,"Hello all,

I am thinking of breaking up with my long distance girl friend. We are both naive, It was her first relationship and my second. We came in contact through a mutual friend; whom we both studied with, at different periods of time but is out of picture now. I initiated, and we started long distance but it was very slow. I tried to speed it up a bit but she didn't wanted to, she wanted to take things slow. I respected that and the long distance continued for like an year. Later, she got unemployed and settled in my city cause her parents moved to the city. There also the relationship was slow. Later when I got placed and it was time to leave city, she initiated kisses but before that we haven't even hugged. After I resettled, it became habit to talk to each other, and around seven months have passed. We are still talking but it has become very boring and monotonous. Only a little bit of flirting and she says she is still shy, whereas I have opened up, I have even told my porn and fetishes.  
I have tried a lot to tell/push her to get a job, so that her mind gets engaged. She is reluctant to act and her grades aren't so good. She has made small changes and is now looking for job but even now she is reluctant to talk to people on linkedin.  
The way I see it is we still thought that we would be able to work it out, though we had little prospect of going to meet each other face to face as we live in far away cities unless she gets a job in my city. The problem is she doesn't have many people to talk to and is depressed and unemployed. I worry if I break up, she might take it hard and can take unnecessary actions but then again she isn't ready to come out of her comfort zone. I am thinking of break up. Please suggest me how should I proceed."
158,"So I have been talking to this guy, and yesterday I was complaining to him about work, and he sent me a picture of Amanda Cerny(some playboy/Instagram model) and told me to “look at this piece of art and you’ll feel better” then he proceeded to talk about how pretty she is. Then when I simply said I’m not interested in pursuing anything with him anymore he acted shocked. He texted me this morning that I misunderstood him and he’s very sorry and I took him too seriously. But nah, that shit is weird right? Lol. I’m not a jealous person, its just what am I even supposed to respond to you talking about how pretty some model is? Also, that’s an awful way to cheer me up when I’m working a 13 hour shift. What do y’all think? He won’t stop saying sorry and begging for me to talk to him again."
159,"I’ve (25M) been seeing a girl (26F) for about a year.

I always felt that when we had an issue that needed to be sorted out, she would shut down. She would feel guilty because she would think she’s not good enough for me. It felt to me that she didn’t want to focus on the difficult aspects of a relationship, rather she was more focused on just having fun and a good time. Which is great but, there’s no growth there either. She used to mention she felt “stuck” too…

She would say things like “you deserve better”, “I hate that you waste your time/energy on me”, “I’m bad for you” or even “You should date \[insert name of her friend here\]”, when we had disagreements or she was feeling judged or feeling bad. When she told me she loved me for the first time and I began to tell her too, there would be times, usually when she'd have a drink, where she'd adamantly believe and say ""You don't love me"" or ""I love you so much more"". However, on plenty of other days she thinks I’m “perfect” and loves the affection and way I treat her.

I feel unbelievably confused by this back and forth. Confused too because sometimes I then stop and wonder, ""is she right about what she's telling me? Does she know something I don't or can't see?"" I love this person and care about her deeply. However, something seems off. I feel there’s something she’s not able to fully explain to me, but something is bothering her and has been for a while (I don’t think it’s the relationship, but rather her own personal issues.)

I feel like it’s incredibly unfair for her to say these things to me, which SUCK and HURT to hear, ONLY to then tell me that I can’t just take what she says literally. She goes on to explain that just because she says something in the *moment* (e.g. “You should date someone else”) doesn’t mean that’s how she truly feels. That I should know, because I’ve gotten to know her, that she loves me and wants to be with me . It’s just what she feels in the moment, not what she feels overall. But that seems like bullshit, no?

I guess from my perspective, sure, I can understand feeling something in the moment, but not feeling that overall. Like I can be angry with people in a moment, but it doesn’t mean I hate them or no longer want them in my life. But saying, “you deserve better” isn’t fair at all is it? Because I do take it at face value. It’s been said a lot and quite frankly I just decided that maybe she is right. It frustrates me a bunch and I try to tell her how shitty it makes me feel to hear her say these things to me (which I don’t feel about her) and to know that she’s feeling guilty and resentful about herself. It usually just feels like she says these things, and I come back and tell her that’s not the case and that she’s great in SO many amazing ways.

It feels like I can’t vent my anger because then it just justifies her claims  to her insisting on me getting someone better. And since I feel unable to fully express my feelings and thoughts and my absolute desire to find compromise and move forward TOGETHER, I write my feelings down or talk to close friends. But I feel that that doesn’t solve the issue. If anything, *I* feel guilty and more resentful in the long run because I *still* can’t express my thought and feelings, because it comes back to “you deserve so much better than me”. I feel my thoughts are becoming angrier and more jaded and feeling just used or played with. And I can’t tell if that’s really the case or just how I feel. This all feels like circular logic to me. I feel stupid and I feel like there’s an awesome relationship here, but there’s something holding her back. But then I think I’m the issue. I just don’t know.

I know no one is perfect by any means, but I accept her “flaws” (hate that word) and I want to work with her. I feel terrible too, because I’m getting tired of telling her that I think the world of her. I’m with her, I spend time with her, we have awesome times together. Hell, she says, “I’m perfect” and loves how I treat her. Yet I still feel terrible that I am starting to feel exhausted trying to show her I care and want to continue being with her. Is that unreasonable? I feel like a bad person for starting to feel this way… because I didn’t always feel this way.

I love her, but I think I need to bite the bullet and do what she says. I should just remove her from my life and put distance between us. It’s been incredibly hard. But I feel this decision would be best for both of us.

Is my thinking wrong here?  It can’t be healthy to keep wondering if my partner is gonna leave or not is it? It can’t be healthy for HER if she’s going through these roller coaster emotions of thinking I’m great but then thinking she’s not good enough and ending things is it? Maybe she is right about it.

TL;DR: Girl I’m seeing goes back and forth between telling me I’m great and amazing, to saying “I deserve someone better” and that I “waste my time on her”. This upsets me and I can’t seem to understand where it stems from. I feel I should just listen to her and move on."
160,"I fucked up. My ex is still living with me until she can move, she has split personality disorder. 
I was sitting by the computer, minding my own things. She was sitting on the other side by her computer as she starts to look at me. She gives me nods as I try to continue on with my business. She then walks up to and puts my hands on her breasts... NSFW
This is one of the alters that still wants me, that 'loves?' me. The others just wants me gone. 

She then came back to her present form and was asking why she was feeling bad. I told her and now she feels sad/angry, hates me even more. 

This is the toughest situation I have ever been in.

I hate myself so much right now. All I want for her to be happy and I do this. 

What can I do? Help me plz."
161,"Basically I met this guy online. I was lonely near my birthday and he said he would take me out to dinner and for a ride on his motorcycle. It was thrilling and then I of course caught feelings. Last Saturday he officially asked me to be his.

The problem is that he's in a bike club. All my friends keep telling me that I'm gonna get hurt and that he's not a good guy to be with. He doesn't exactly listen to the rules of the road or any other rules really. And my friends think that he's too possessive. 

But I of course really like this guy. I love how possessive he is and how bad he is. But I also really like our conversations and how smart he is. I love talking to him about books and magic and whatever else. We just connect I guess and I forget everything bad that's been going on when I'm with him. 

I just don't know what to do. All of my friends think I'm psychotic for dating him.

Should I end it or do my own thing and see how it goes?"
162,"So in the next month I'm moving to a new apartment to be closer to my girlfriend. After I told her last night my application has been submitted, she asked am I doing this for me as well or for her. She then followed up with would I still be happy in the unfortunate unlikely event that we broke up. These seemed odd to me and I was wondering if there's something she is trying to tell me. Or is she actually just asking those because she cares?"
163,"This year has been bittersweet year for me 18(M).
I lost too many old friendships and had bad heartbreak.
I was very attached to them. Due to this I suffered emotionally and mentally a lot. It affected studuies to very high extend. I wasted 8 months in this shit. 
Lately whenever I talk to existing friends or make new friends I try to be detached with them so I dont have to suffer pain in future. And this has made me a little numb. Today I realised that being detached and unemotional may prevent suffering in case things go bad but it also prevents happiness. So by being unemotional only nuetral state of mind can be continued and it prevents happiness. What should be done regarding this?"
164,"Hey guys. Here’s some backstory. I graduated high school in 2018 and I’ve had a job ever since I graduated. I go to college and only take about 3 classes a semester because my work schedule is so messed up. I normally work 4pm-1am so I don’t come home until 1:30 most nights and I don’t actually fall asleep until 3 or 4am. It doesn’t bother me, I just sleep until 10am so I have enough time to go to my classes and do all my work for the classes. The problem is that I’m still indecisive about what I want to do after college so I keep on telling my parents about all the opportunities I have and the things I could do which I now realize was a huge mistake. 

Lately they’ve been throwing everything I was ever passionate about or any ideas I’ve had like right in my face. They tell me my current major isn’t really good because I don’t have any experience. Then they tell me I can’t do the hobbies I want to because “they’re not for people like me”. Then they tell me to move out even though it’s literally impossible because California prices are ridiculous and when I tell them I can move to a cheaper state and work and go to college there they say I can’t and that I should wait and that I would never make it on my own. 

They tell me I’m lazy because I sleep until ten and when I tell them it’s because of my weird schedule they say my life is easy and that I should be up early with them. I feel like I can’t do anything right. I go to school and I work. I’m not addicted to drugs and I don’t drink and I don’t go to parties like literally all I do is sleep, work, go to school. When I’m at home I watch TV and do homework and when they start arguing with me they always tell me how I’m way too obsessed with watching TV and I don’t do ANYTHING. 

This entire thing is just resulting in sleepless nights and me changing my major every few months because they tell me what I want “isn’t for me”. I don’t know what to do anymore or where to even start. If anyone read this to the end does anyone have any advice? Thank you!!!"
165,"Warning - Pretty damn long post, but I need help so any insight is appreciated  


Things with my fiancé (we’ve been together for 2.5 yrs)and I have been rocky lately to say the least. We’ve been arguing a whole lot over stupid small shit, which I know to be an indicator of bigger issues. However we also argue over some pretty real things. So, my fiancé just graduated college, and just moved in with me in my apartment and is working part-time at a coffee shop. I’m employed at a very large music retailer in a commission-based sales position. I’m fairly new to the position, so I’m working on building a clientele and business is ramping up, but slowly. It’s a very stressful position, but I’m working with stuff that I love, and management is saying they think I’m going to do very well at the job. I make a considerable amount more than she does, so obviously I’m going to be paying most of the rent/bills etc. The thing that bugs me is that she doesn’t pay for anything... like at all. I receive $0 a month from her to help with bills and stuff. She doesn’t buy groceries, and she doesn’t really contribute much of anything. Cleaning, dog walking and all that is pretty much also all done by me with some exceptions. 

Another important detail is that she has a physical condition. She’s got a female reproductive condition known as Endometriosis. It’s incredibly debilitating to her, and when she’s having flare-ups she’s in a decent amount to a great amount of pain. Of course, when she’s having flare-ups she is pretty much unable to do things around the apartment when it comes to cleaning and the like. I have never once given her any grief for not doing anything when she is having a flare-up. It’s a medical condition, so I would definitely be an asshole if I were to push her to do things when she’s in pain. I also do everything I can to help her mitigate the pain where I can. Massages to her lower back tend to help with the pain, so I oblige when I can to help her not hurt. One day, she was saying how she wasn’t having much any pain, and I asked if she’d be willing to do the dishes. She said sure. I get home, they’re not done. I let her know that I was bummed because I do so much of the housework and I asked her to do the dishes to help out just a bit. I was pretty bummed, but I was calm about it, as I’m definitely guilty for not doing things that I said I would do before. Double standard time: When I say that I’m going to do things around the apartment, and then don’t she gets upset, and talks about how I should take more initiative to quote her ver batim. I let her know how unfair that is, and she wouldn’t budge, so I went to bed frustrated.  

Things came to a head about a week or so back. For a bit more context, she has never been out on her own before, and I have been on my own since I was 18, so we come from very different experiences. I got her to agree to pay half of 2 of our smallest bills to help ease her into things. Time came for those bills to be due and the grand total I needed from her was about $60... Sixty fucking dollars... I asked her for it, and she got really shitty. This was while I was at work, and we were talking over text. When she got shitty over me asking for $60, I snapped. I took an “early lunch” and went straight home and I really let her have it. I told her I felt like I had a dependent, not a partner, and I told her that I was at the end of my rope. I was mad. Like Mad mad. I was on the verge of dumping her then. She seemed very receptive and apologetic, and said that she would put in more of an effort.  

This, on top of all of the other fights we’ve been having are just driving me crazy. And when I say fights I mean like yelling at each other. I’ve been making a very conscious effort to better my communication skills. I’ve been going to therapy, taking medication that my doctors recommended during a psych evaluation, and I’ve been meditating a lot which has been really helpful to me. I’ve been trying my hardest to keep my cool during fights, and letting her know when I need to take a step back for a minute to gather my thoughts, because the conversation just isn’t going to be productive when we’re both so heated. She does NOT like that. Despite me saying I want to revisit the conversation later, she will stay put. If I move she follows. If I try to leave she blocks the door. This is 100% abusive behavior, and I let her know. She says I’m being overly sensitive (more abuse) and it just gets to the point where I feel like I’m going to explode. Every time, about a couple hours after the fight, she apologizes and says that she knows what she did was wrong. I told her that sorry isn’t good enough. I need her to be better. She agrees. We move on. 

I just didn’t feel it. My patience was just at a bit of a weak point. I just wanted out. I asked my dad, my mom, and my step-mom and they all said that it was a bad situation and that I needed to cut it off. I tried to break things off a couple of days later. I woke her up and we talked for a long, long time. There were lots of tears, apologies and anger and all sorts of feelings that come up when having this conversation. She begged me for some more time for her to put in more effort. After some convincing, I agreed. She’s now going to therapy, taking medication for her mental health, and things like that. However, we still haven’t discussed things like finances. I’m trying so so hard to take things one day at a time. I’m calling her out on bullshit the second it comes up, and I’m just not putting up with the stuff that I would before. Obviously I’m still not coming down on her for not being able to do things when her illness is affecting her, but I just don’t feel the same as I did. I do truly love her, and I want so badly to want to make it work, but I’m just so tired. We have fights an awful lot, and I absolutely abhor conflict, so I’m just exhausted emotionally, and am nervous about making rash decisions that I may regret later.  

Obviously, this is just one side of the story. She has her own view of things, and I know that she’s genuinely putting in an effort to do better. I know she’s not doing these things out of malice, it’s just a mixture of learned toxic behavior (comes from her mother, who is incredibly manic), lack of experience being in the real world, having a crippling physical condition. I just feel micromanaged, I feel like my patience, and willingness to help those that I love is being taken advantage of even if not intentionally, and I feel just... tired... I don’t know what to do, because part of me wants to cut it off, because I’m unhappy and I just need her to grow up a bit, but the other part of me wants to give her a chance because I feel like I may be being unfair due to her physical/mental health issues, and I don’t want to miss out on what could be an amazing relationship. Any advice helps. 

TL;DR – Fiance doesn’t do much to help with finances/cleaning. I called her out and tried to break up and now she is wanting to put in more effort. Not seeing much improvement but feel like I may be being unfair."
166,"So my past relationships, I’ve always got accused of cheating, or flirting with other girls even though I had no intentions with other girls. My ex who accused me the most, ended up cheating on me and leaving me for another guy and left me wondering why. Every relationship I get into now i always get jealous when they text other guys but I don’t say anything in the moment. I let it build up and last night she got a text saying “let’s chill soon” and I had no clue who he was. I ended up mimicking him and telling her “hey let’s chill soon” so she knew I saw that text when we were laying down. And it started an argument, her telling me I don’t trust her and saying she doesn’t even text that guy very often. Well the guy ended up calling her and she answered (we’ve been talking for 6 months now) and he asked her to come over. She said she was at her boyfriends house and the kid hung up the phone. I felt so stupid and like how I did when my ex use to accuse me of cheating. I know how to handle myself except when I get jealous. I kinda ruined the night and it felt like I was pushing her away and I can see how she feels cause it’s happened to me before. Like she didn’t ask for anything that happened, and I know she wouldn’t cheat on me but I still can’t stop myself from thinking the worse when guys hit her up like that. Im okay with her texting guys, until I see them trying to make a move on her. I’m really scared of losing her and I can see it happening if I keep doing this, i don’t know why I get so hurt so fast and assume she’s like all the girls in my past. I want to change but I don’t know how to get myself out of that shitty mindset. How can I handle myself differently in those situations instead of just blowing up and causing stress and tension towards her and myself? I really want to change my perspective but it’s so hard in the moment. Another thing is she isn’t very open with sensitive topics, like she shuts down and won’t talk about it and it eats me up. I just don’t like not knowing what she’s going though or what she’s thinking, and I think it’s annoying to her when I try to talk to her about it. We have a great relationship besides those two things. Am I overthinking everything? I just so worried about losing another person that I fell for and I think I love this girl and I do want her in my life, sometimes it feels like I portray myself differently then what I’m thinking and I just feel so dumb after all of this."
167,"Hello all,

I am thinking of breaking up with my long distance girl friend. We are both naive, It was her first relationship and my second. We came in contact through a mutual friend; whom we both studied with, at different periods of time but is out of picture now. I initiated, and we started long distance but it was very slow. I tried to speed it up a bit but she didn't wanted to, she wanted to take things slow. I respected that and the long distance continued for like an year. Later, she got unemployed and settled in my city cause her parents moved to the city. There also the relationship was slow. Later when I got placed and it was time to leave city, she initiated kisses but before that we haven't even hugged. After I resettled, it became habit to talk to each other, and around seven months have passed. We are still talking but it has become very boring and monotonous. Only a little bit of flirting and she says she is still shy, whereas I have opened up, I have even told my porn and fetishes.  
I have tried a lot to tell/push her to get a job, so that her mind gets engaged. She is reluctant to act and her grades aren't so good. She has made small changes and is now looking for job but even now she is reluctant to talk to people on linkedin.  
The way I see it is we still thought that we would be able to work it out, though we had little prospect of going to meet each other face to face as we live in far away cities unless she gets a job in my city. The problem is she doesn't have many people to talk to and is depressed and unemployed. I worry if I break up, she might take it hard and can take unnecessary actions but then again she isn't ready to come out of her comfort zone. I am thinking of break up. Please suggest me how should I proceed."
168,"We met in LA and we both currently live in SoCal. We do not currently live together. But job opportunities are scarce where we are for what we’re looking for and we are in the beginning phases of planning to move to NYC.

Her family is from Brooklyn and my family is from Boston, so a move to the east coast makes sense there. 

We’ve been dating for about 2 years. I like living out here but she is really pushing to go back, and the move makes sense for both of us. We both have family/friends there. 

 But just moving across the country, moving in with a SO for the first time, it’s a lot for me to handle, and I’m nervous. Any advice to make sure it goes smoothly?"
169,"She didn’t know much of the man who gave her the baby was, such as where he lives and last name?"
170,"When I (21f) was in high school I briefly ‘dated’ this guy(20m) in my grade. I always had a crush on him and was so happy when he texted me asking to go on a date. He was my second kiss. We went on like four/five dates and we were kissing all the time. Then he told me he couldn’t date me right now as he was pretty into drugs at the time and didn’t want to hurt me (I guess??). I was upset, but he was nice about it. I figured that we could still hook up and I put the offer on the table.. he agreed. 

I had texted him once more and he answered, but I chickened out and didn’t ask him to hang out... and then we did not talk for four years. Like he would see me everywhere and straight up ignore me and pretend he didn’t know me. On top of this he was always a customer at my work and I would have to check his items and he would just act like we were complete strangers. For years. This hurt my feelings and confused me bc he was the one who dumped me, i didn’t get why he avoided me all the time. 

Finally this past summer I saw him and I made it a point to be super friendly.. and to my surprise he was nice back. We have a ton of mutual friends and I saw him a month ago too, and he was again,.. really friendly, addressing me by name, asking me about my life and even complimented me. 

I still think he’s super handsome and funny (always have!) and was wondering what you guys make of his behaviour. He’s pretty awkward which maybe was why he avoided me for so long. The only thing is that my other ex I dated afterwards is his friend (they aren’t that close tho). Do you guys think I have any chance? I always wished things had gone differently."
171,"I am 21M, we have been dating for a year now. I will try my best to put it in both of our perspectives, and if I am being jealous and insecure, do not hesitate to call me out. I realise that it can be a faulty perspective as well and I would like to change that. I've put both our views being as objective as I can be - 

My Perspective: We've been together for a year now, and we are going through that time when the honeymoon phase of the relationship is over. I initially thought that there would be an adjustment phase which would be difficult, but what happened was that one day she started talking to some guy on Instagram. Ever since that day, she has been weird and distant. After a week or so, she straight up said that she has lost interest in talking to me. Then she wanted space - no contact for a while, just to sort things out. I respected her space, even though I felt abandoned and betrayed. It turns out she was talking to this guy. We start talking again, and still she is constantly on call/or texting him. Everything is different now. Then she tells me that he Drunk Dialled her and told her that he likes her so much, and discussed the possibility of dating. She told him about me, that she is dating me and that they cannot. He later Apologizes. My gf is very transparent and has told me everything every step of the way. They've been talking for all of 10 days now. That guy is 36, doesn't have a proper job, and makes weird comments and hits on her.

Her perspective: She hasn't had any good friends, ever. She does have friends but she doesn't have any best friends, so to say. She started talking to this person and they connected really well. They can talk about things that are not at all serious and whatever. The drunk dialling thing was very wrong and she said she made it very clear to him. She participated in the discussion because she knew she has no intention of ever dating him or getting involved, because he's old. She says that she needs this support in her life and wants to have friends. She is going out more, calling her old friends. Talking to people. She is talking to him all the time, however. Much, much more than me. She says that she wanted space from me because she realised that if she stops talking to me she has no one to fall back on and wanted this for herself so that she can figure out things for herself. That she started talking to him when she wanted space was just coincidence. She says that she takes everything too seriously and that he's a fresh perspective which she likes having. That his drunk calling was wrong but it was just something that happens and she doesn't want to judge him because he's old. She feels that I am being jealous and insecure, that she cannot make everything revolve around me and that we don't need to talk everyday or everytime.

We are not talking at the moment. I said that I needed space, so we are at an impasse.

Is this even worth saving now? I feel very conflicted

TL;DR gf(21)of one year started talking to old guy(36) and things aren't the same anymore. I(21M) feel uncomfortable with this whole thing, and from her perspective she is making a friend"
172,"My husband and I have been married for just over a year and a half. Lately, I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake by marrying my husband. I was talking with my husband about the future, our plans, etc. He doesn't like thinking too much about the future for whatever reason but I find it really helpful. Eventually, I bring up the topic of Thanksgiving. He hasn't wanted to discuss our plans and always brushes it off. He always does this when he thinks we might end up arguing. But not talking about it causes us to argue anyway, so it's stupid.

I told him that I really want to visit my family out of state. He thinks that going on this trip is too much of a hassle for him. It's a ten hour drive and flying is out of the question due to cost.  He was acting almost whiny and just getting mad just talking about the possibility of going. I get that driving out of state for a five day trip can be a pain but I've expressed multiple times how important this is to me. He's dragging his feet and telling me if we go he won't have a good time. He doesn't want to have to drive and be in the car for so long during his only break in the semester. I understand his view but I was a bit astounded at his reasoning. Also, his family lives 20 minutes away from us and we see them almost every week. We haven't visited my family since before we got married and haven't been able to spend any holidays with them. Sometimes I just really need to see them and I feel like he just doesn't care enough to support me. I love him and I have sacrificed so much for him and do so daily. It just feels like he won't put in that same effort.

This sucked to hear but what makes it worse is we talked more and somehow got to the point where he admitted he just doesn't care about things anymore. Like going places and doing activities with me. He said he used to, but he's learned that things suck and it isn't worth it to try anymore. Given his behavior, I'd say it's true. Since we've been married, we almost never go anywhere or do things together. We've had financial and transportation restraints in the past but now, there's no reason we can't just go do stuff together. He's fine with getting dinner and watching TV and that's basically all we ever do together. I feel like we're barely living.

I made a joke to him that maybe he's just depressed and that he probably doesn't believe in that anyway. I know this sounds insensitive but I live with depression and he's never seemed to understand what it's like. After last night though, I'm wondering if maybe he really could be depressed and doesn't realize it. After I made the ""joke"" he stopped speaking to me. He just kind of stared off and then started doing stuff on his phone. I told him I was going to bed and he just said ""okay."" We haven't spoken since and I honestly don't even know what to say to him after that conversation.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just now realizing that maybe neither of us are happy in our relationship and our lives are far less than ideal. I'm trying to communicate better but it's just opening up a painful reality that our goals, intentions and interests are not at all in sync. I want to experience life and I want to make memories with him but he's apathetic towards everything, including me. He only ever seems content when he's playing video games, watching tv or staring at his phone. I'm at a loss. I don't know who to turn to and I feel so alone in this. What can I do to help him? What if this is just how things are going to be? I feel hopeless for the future if this is what our marriage is going to be like.

TL;DR: My husband has become apathetic towards life and our future. Does he not love me? Is he depressed? I don't know what to say or how to help him."
173,"So, I’m a serial monogamist. I support my asexual and poly friends, I don’t judge. I’m fairly laid back. I’ve also been on the dating scene for about a year after I took about six months off after a serious relationship ended. I’m in weekly therapy, improving little by little, and being very cautious along the way. 

I started dating this guy a month ago. Roughly one month after I broke up with my ex (who I was only with five months, who essentially forced me to change my FB statuts to “prove that I was committed” in addition to other controlling and quasi abusive behaviors - hence why I dipped). 

I’m getting the side eye from friends because I’m, in their mind, relationship hopping. After the last guy, because they feel they know me better than I know myself and coming from a place of care, said I should just not date. Cool. I can do that. But then I met this guy, and like, things click and not in the normal way. Like, he respects my boundaries and he encourages me in ways I’ve never been encouraged or supported. He isn’t clingy or controlling, he has no red flags I’ve seen, and to be sure I’m not rose colored glasses viewing him, we had a double date last night with one of my friends who legit will find something wrong with every man. She didn’t find something wrong with him. 

This guy is legit a unicorn. Handsome. Educated. Driven. Respectful. Friendly. Funny. Single, full time dad. When we talked about DTR last night, I said, “I’m okay to commit, but you won’t meet my children any time soon.” Instead of getting upset or hurt, he simply said, “Well, if we get to a point where you’re ready, let me know. If that’s years from now, that’s years from now. I’m in no rush because this feels real and I want to show you I respect you.”

So. Back to my dilemma. We decided last night to be committed: I told the one other guy I was seeing I’m exclusive now. I told boyfriend that I’m all for being committed, but I don’t want to change my FB status unless we reach a point that we’re talking long term commitment. He said he was fine with it. 

The reason? I don’t want to catch hell from my friends. Isn’t that stupid? 

What would you do?

Tl; dr: I’m now in a committed relationship, but I don’t want to change my FB status because I don’t want to catch hell from my friends, but it makes me feel guilty as though I’m not proud to have this unicorn of a man on my arm. 

Sigh."
174,"I have a FWB that has been on and off for about a year that I'm also great friends with. Recently I caught feelings for him and ended up endangering his existing relationship (he's attached) apparently thru my shitty lack of carefulness in such a FWB setup (boundaries apparently have to be set and abided by closely). 

Now he's annoyed at me cos of what I did and also cos in my frenzied desperation (I panicked cos he told me he essentially wasn't interested in me for anything beyond sex) I begged him to end the FWB with (ironically) more physical touch. He rejected this request.

I'm emotionally exhausted now because (1) I feel majorly unloveable and this whole incident has dented my pride hugely and (2) I'm so afraid I'll lose my friendship with him.

How do I move on now?
Both in terms of my shattered ego and trying to get my friendship with my friend back. 

And, should I still try to get things back to FWB level? (For context the sex is amazing.)"
175,"My fiancé and I have been together for almost 10 years and we are getting married  in 2 months’ time.

I have always wanted to marry him. He could always calm me and make me feel safe. We had been sweet and felt happy for each other’s company. 

Things changed in the past few months. We fight big over small things. We argue almost every day. He always says I am being defensive and not willing to take in advice. But I feel like he is always blaming me, which may make me defensive. We tend to lose our temper when we discuss further and I usually end up crying. He seems to be pretty annoyed by this. 

We talk less now. I feel distant from him.

I am lost. I doubt if this phrase would be temporary, and if our bond is strong enough to make it through this time. 

What should I do? If we separate, I am not sure if I have the strength to carry on with my life. 

How I wish time could rewind to our happiest days.

Thanks for reading."
176,"On any other topic I think I could hammer out thousands of words, and tell you exactly what I think and feel. When I am talking to my girlfriend about our relationship or even trying to write up a post on this sub I just can't do it. I really struggle to articulate my thoughts and emotions when it comes to our relationship or even specific problems that we have.

I think that I get anxious about being identified, about giving bad information, about acting on advice that was given (in good faith) on bad information. What if I am misreading the situation? What if I am seeking validation for bad behaviours that I have, but don't acknowledge or won't admit to?

It mainly feels like I don't know how I feel. Does anyone have any advice for getting it all out there?"
177,"My boyfriend is always the one to initiate between me and him. Unless I'm drunk and don't care then I just pounce on him and kiss him. Other wise, he always starts with foreplay but sometimes i want it and I'm not sure how to seduce him?
 
I love dressing up for him in the bedroom so if i usually get a new piece or dress up one night, he instantly wants to have sex. BUT I want to seduce him, like I want him to want me so bad but not be able to touch me.

Do you guys have any advice on what I can do to please him more?"
178,I(34F) recently told my boyfriend (43M) he isn't that great of a catch like he think he is. If he was I wouldn't have had the catch to have met him. He's never been married or had children before. We were just talking about so many different things and what he has to offer. Am I a horrible person for that?
179,"I’m 20 straight female. My friend is female 21.
Long story short, made a new friend whom told me about her last relationship from a year back and how it hurt her (I don’t know her ex personally).

She can’t stop updating me about little irrelevant bits of his new life (his new date, her bumping into his friends which seems to happen quite frequently etc). 

She’s obviously still very caught up about it and supposedly wants to “break free” from this but she keeps keeping tabs on his life, shading him online etc. I’m genuinely disinterested and I feel like she’s not helping herself move on even though she said she wanted to. I told her to see a therapist but obviously she’s not prioritising that, which is 100% her choice but I’m not replacement for therapy. 

How can I help and what can I say? Or at least, stop her from updating me about someone I don’t know personally? I feel like she’s crossing my boundary. 

Tldr: friend can’t stop talking about ex. How to help / get her to stop?"
180,"TLDR at the bottom 

R and I have been broke up for over a year. I left him after 7 years when the relationship got to toxic. The fights were getting violent and we were turning on each other and saying the most awful shit. 

Truth is, even after being with him 7 years, I’ve never been in love with him. Not even a little bit. Which I’ve always been upfront and honest about especially seeing him again.

Well. I had relapsed on drinking (bc well excuses) and he seen his opportunity and took it. (He’s best friends with my cousins bf, hence why we were around each other that night) he waited till I was drunk and started getting hands/flirty and me being the slut that I am, I gave in just to shut him up about it.

Jokes on me tho. Apparently after seeing me in passing 3 weeks prior he met some girl and slept with her a few times (totally outta character. He’s not that type of guy that meets chicks and just sleeps with them) so it was a little “get back” at me. And we slept together 3 weeks after.

the girl burned him. (Meaning she knew she was infected with gonorrhea and never told him) He said they used condoms but it broke during one of the times with her. 

I know he didn’t purposely infect me because he’s not that type of person. 

But even after sleeping together I told him this in NO way means we’re getting back together. I’ve been on my own and I’m enjoying it. I don’t want to be with anyone right now. And then him telling me what he had... I even strongly urged him away from me. 

Now he’s at my house and I keep hinting like asking him when he’s leaving things like that. AFTER I’ve told him multiple times were not getting back together, I don’t love him, and don’t want to be with. ESPECIALLY after what happened and how it happened. 

What the fuck do I do reddit?

TLDR; hooked up with ex bf after being broken up for a year. He gave me gonorrhea and now won’t leave me alone in hopes we’ll get back together. I told him straight out I don’t want to be with him, I don’t love him, and I want to be single and by myself. He won’t listen and won’t leave my apartment. What do I do?

Edit: added TLDR"
181,"We've been together for 7 months, and really have a wonderful relationship. We're in a long distance relationship, live in different countries. I've never felt like this for anyone before. It's a serious relationship and not just a fling. I just want our relationship to be a lovely happy fairytale but i realize I'm naive. I live at home with my family, so I wouldn't risk telling them about my boyfriend. 

I've been thinking of telling my older half sister about my boyfriend. She's 30. She's kind of cool and we've had a few heart to heart talks, and they went well. My friend said she might react badly, and I am worried about that. She also asked what good telling her would bring. My boyfriend also isn't keen on it, mainly because my sister is moving to another country for 2 years and he thinks I should wait until after she comes back. Maybe that's a good idea....but I feel weirdly impatient. 

I'm not sure why I want to tell her. Perhaps I naively hope she'd approve of our relationship and me and my boyfriend could come visit. But mainly it's about feeling sad that no one knows about our relationship. I feel sad that I have to keep him a secret when he's such an amazing part of my life. I want our relationship to be like a normal relationship. I also feel slightly sad he hasn't mentioned telling his family (which consists of his older sister, actually). But I understand....

 I'm not sure why I feel so sad about this situation, it really hurts. 

Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you deal with it? Should I tell her or not?"
182,"So basically I'm a very open person. I really don't care to hide like some guys about watching porn or jacking off. If I met you 30seconds ago and you ask me if I do I'll tell you fuck yeah I do. I'm not a porn addict. I don't watch it everyday. I only watch it on days I'm very horny and I'm not seeing my GF. I see my GF most days and I prefer her then porn. I litterally tell her when I jackoff Everytime.

 I wish I had nudes of her(only have 3 as she's shy about it) and porn with her because I absolutely lust after her and no other girl like that. 

So yesterday it came up and she was like wait you watch porn??? I was like uhhh yeah I've littlerally told you Everytime I do. She got very offended we had just had sex and we were still cuddling. As soon as I said it she got up put on her clothes and went to the other room. I didn't understand I told her Everytime I did. To me jacking off and porn go hand in hand. She told me when I told her I jacked off she didn't know I watched porn. I told her I've been really honest with her. And if it makes her feel less or unworthy I won't anymore.

 I don't get It though I ask her for nudes Absolutely all the time. I fucking love my GFs body. It's amazing if I had pics and made porn with her I'd absolutely prefer it. Yet she doesn't want too. I even open up the nudes I do have of her and jackoff to them all the time. But 3 pics is very boring. She didn't believe me that I do that. She said I was trying to make her feel better and that's bullshit I think of the girl and I start getting hard

 I told her I understand it bugs you and if it does I'll stop. But it's not like I prefer porn over her. Only time I do it is if I'm super horny and need to release my tension knowing I'm not seeing her that day. I don't have any porn saved on my phone. I don't watch it often."
183,"Back in HS, there was this girl I liked that also (apparently) had a crush on me at the time, but I didn’t end up going for her since I started dating someone else briefly afterwards for no good reason.
We were very good friends for a while, even going to prom together and often doing stuff together too, and I had a great time with her, and now I’m having regrets. We’re sophomores in college now, and over the summer, I tried to see her more and see if I could get anywhere. However, she got a new job (45+ hours per week) where she would never be around anymore, and by the time she got off of work, she was pretty much asleep for the day. She really was only free on Saturday, but would often be with her family as well. I made attempts at planning stuff with her, but she was always busy. It might sound like she was avoiding me, but I know she wasn’t, I was talking with some friends and the same happened with them. She was just exceptionally busy, and she even said this herself to some of my friends when she was asked why she was never around. I saw her a few times over the summer, one being a “double date” with one of her friends and the guy she was with, but I didn’t see her as much as I would’ve liked.
I would try to go for it again right now, but we go to two colleges that are far away from each other, and I don’t know how to strike up a conversation at the moment, or how I should go about this once we’re on winter break. Both her friends and mine want me to go for it and think it would work, but I don’t see how I can even go about this.

What’s the best way to handle this so it works out, even if it’s just restarting the same friendship we had back then? I regret not making a move in high school and want to try and go for it now, even if it doesn’t work. I just don’t know what to do about the scheduling conflicts."
184,"I’m with my boyfriend [24M] for 8 months now and we never really had a fight, just some serious discussions and just telling me/him something done that is upsetting. We communicate well with each other and are really in love. We also have talks about getting married and having a family together in the future.

He is my first boyfriend and when certain things happen, I find it hard to react properly. I also just moved to a new country and I’m very busy with work and studies, so I find it challenging to get a hobby/do something without my boyfriend as I only get 2 full days off one week, and one full day off on another week. My boyfriend and I wants us to spend our day offs together. And an additional weeknight or two. 

Back in my home country, I thought I never needed a boyfriend as I have my life together - career, going to the gym every day before work, meeting with different friend groups regularly during the week, spending family time, etc. But when I moved here, I felt like I have to reestablish myself. I don’t have a lot of friends here outside of my boyfriend’s group, whom I can meet on a regular basis, my bestie lives really far and we only get to see each other once during the week, I also think I don’t have time anymore to go to the gym as much as I did before, and think I’m too busy to get a new hobby outside of the relationship. I also think I kinda started to feel a bit insecure since I moved here. 

I’m so thankful for my boyfriend for taking me to hangout with his family and friends regularly, I feel like a have a family now here and new friends. 

I’m almost always the first one to text during the day. My boyfriend used to call me a lot during the first few months. I used to get upset before when he chooses to spend time with friends instead of me, but I actively changed my behavior and whenever he says he’s going to hang out with the boys, I just tell him to have fun. 

There’s also instances wherein I expressed to my boyfriend my jealousy over one girl in our friend group who seems to be being extra friendly with my boyfriend, and he has always reassured me that I’m the only one and she’s just a friend. This issue was recently closed as the girl talked to me and told me my boyfriend always tells them that he thinks I’m the one and he’s so happy with me. I told my boyfriend that I’m sorry for thinking of her that way before, she seems like a nice person and I would stop being jealous of your friendship with her.

Then, just recently, my boyfriend has a lot of things going on for him - work, studies, family matters. He also told me the other day he wanted to move in with me, so I searched for places to move in to for us and also asked the owner of the house I’m currently staying at if we can make arrangements for him to move in, and she agreed. So I’ve also been sending him messages about these as I thought he wanted to move urgently. I wanted to be there for him to support him. He told me he’s seeing me tonight after work, after 3 days of not seeing each other, however, he just canceled a few hours before telling me I shouldn’t take it the wrong way but he just doesn’t feel like spending the night together. This is the first time he said that so I was caught off guard and overreacted like asking him why, did I do anything wrong, is he no longer happy with me, etc., with which he said i shouldn’t overreact as this is the first time he said no to seeing each other as he said he just have a lot going on. Then I said sorry for bothering him and I’ll wait for him when he’s ready to talk, and told him I hope nothing has changed. He reassured me nothing has changed and he will try to see me the next day. I also ended up calling him as soon as I got home just to say sorry again for how I reacted and tell him I understand, I’m just sad we’re not seeing each other like the usual. He told me he needs to focus on his paper which is due next week, and that he always love to see me, it’s just that he doesn’t feel like it tonight. He said he’ll see me very soon as soon as his paper is done so he’ll be comfortable and I told him I understand and he told me he loves me.

I feel really guilty for reacting that way to his request for space. I want to change for the better so I don’t risk pushing him away. I want to be the best girlfriend for him, and at the same time be the best person I can be for myself. Hoping for your advice and thoughts. 

Tl;dr: I’ve shown clingy behavior and I wanted to stop"
185,"
Rent alone is $3650

I make 210k. He makes 42k as a 1099.

He currently gives me $1600/month and I pay the rest of rent ($2050) plus car payment, all bills and most food. I also buy furniture and appliances and pay for our vacations and lots of activities but dining out is about 50/40. I put all the deposit for our rental home.

If based on income percentage ratio. What should it really be?

Sorry for all the typos on title"
186,"Me and my boyfriend (20f) (24m) have been together for 1 year and a half. We’re in a LDR, so we visit each other every month. We’re both European, so we can manage to see each other every month.
However, since the beginning he has always been very cheap. Everytime we would go out for lunch or dinner (or any kind of activities really) he would never pay. I can’t remember the last time he paid for something. 
Now, it’s important to mention that I’m a uni student in my last year and I have no job. I have received a lot of money from my relatives for my birthday so I’m relying on that and holding on to that, trying and saving up as much as I can but it’s literally impossible because whenever he comes over, he never reaches for his wallet and pays for the both of us. Ever.
He has a high paying stable job but will still refuse to pay. I remember when I was visiting him, I told him I wanted to go out for dinner and he said “no, it’s too expensive” but when I offered to pay he quickly got out of the couch and put his shoes on and said “well then let’s go”. This is just one of the many miserable and ridiculous episodes that have happened to me.
I’m a girl, I love to be spoiled once in a while, but he fails to make me happy like that. I have always paid for every single thing.

Today I told him I wanna buy a pair of jeans because all of them fit me very loosely since I have lost weight (I was always skinny, but lately I’ve been losing weight exponentially) and he said “gain weight, that’s cheaper” I’M IN DISBELIEF.
What should my next move be? We’re gonna close the distance next year but after seeing all of this (and much more) I can only think of how unhappy my future is gonna look like"
187,"I never promised him anything, I don't want to hurt him, but I don't wanna put my life on hold because he can't accept the fact that I'm not into him. I know it would be hard for him to accept (especially since I've showed no interest in that possibility) but I really like this guy, and unlike other people, he's not likely to be a dick to me and he's genuinely interested in me. 
Am I being a jerk? Should I slowly walk away? I don't have many friends since I'm new in town, so I don't wanna lose him either."
188,"my girlfriend just ended our year long relationship that I thought was kinda serious out of nowhere and without us really trying to make it work but we ended on a kinda positive note and just want some advice on how to move on and keep my hear up through all this stress and hard work being a college student that also works 25-30 hours a week without many friends
thank you for your kind words in advance and any negative comments will just be deleted."
189,"Im a senior in highschool and have been my theater's construction crew chief for all of last year and apprenticed it sophomore year. The entire time ive been a co chief with my friend Megan(fake name), we kinda stopped talking outside of tech last year and  Recently its been coming to me that shes been talking shit to alot of people about how I dont do anything (even though shes not there about a quarter of the time because shes working, leaving me to pick up her end.) and that I do everything wrong and that I chose a run crew of just people I liked. Normally I wouldnt give a shit but shes doing it in a way that harms in me in the long run position wise. Im gonna talk to her either today or tomorrow and ask what her problem is with me and that she should say it to my face. Thats all i really plan on saying and hope it sparks a conversation about my alleged mistakes and how i can grow from them and/or which are false. Anyone have anything else for me to say?"
190,"Please note that this is a throwaway account! Sorry if it's long, feel free to skip down for tl;dr :) So here goes:

I matched with this guy on a dating site about 3/4 months ago. He's about 6/7 years older than me and a Scorpio. Let's call him David (not his real name). We hit it off pretty well at first and he would compliment me a lot. David would always try and make plans with me to go on a date, but always disappear or bring up excuses at the last minute (mostly blaming work and financial troubles). We finally met up though, and we hung out for about like an hour until he left. After that we started to talk less and less.

David would tell me how much he liked me, and how he hopes that I won't find anyone new while he's busy with work. When I finally admitted that I liked him I may have gone a little overboard, because I would call him out multiple times on disappearing all of a sudden, sometimes for days on end. So after a week or two of not hearing from him anymore, I saw him walk by at a park. He stopped to look at me for a few seconds and then kept on walking as if he never saw me.

So after a while I had enough of this and while most people would have dropped it already, normally I would have too but he led me on for so long and obviously I was hurt so I told my best friend about all of this. Let's call her Sarah. We googled David out of boredom and found his work number. I suggested that Sarah should message him and so she did. He took some time to respond, but after a while they somehow hit it off and he told her the reasons why he ghosted me. He also told her that he DID NOT see me at that park, although I did see him looking towards my direction and he stopped for a while before walking off. Apparently he noticed that I had started to like him and he found me way too emotional, and since he was afraid to hurt me and started to lose interest he just ghosted me. Even though he admitted to her that it was a pathetic thing to do and that he isn't proud of it.

But then he finally texted me back, I guess to be nice or something. I remember I was out with her that evening, and I told him we were nearby and he said he'll be out too. He came out and scared me from behind although he didn't talk to me much that evening, he kept on chatting to Sarah more. I guess it's because I felt kind of awkward and didn't know what to say, whereas she always kept the conversation going and yadda. The next day I had to attend a birthday party so David ended up asking Sarah to hang out with him alone, since I was gone. She ended up going (mainly because I suggested it)

It then turns out that David had tried to make a move on Sarah at the end of the evening, but she rejected him. Now I should note that Sarah has a boyfriend and has been with him for a while and I did mention it to David already, so he was aware. Sarah also made it clear she was in a relationship. Apparently he even asked Sarah various questions about her relationship, and by the end of the day he tried to kiss her though she rejected his advances. David, of course, apologized and just told her that he thought she was into him and then pulled back.

David started to ignore and talk to me less again, all the while he kept on texting Sarah all the time. Sarah is also pregnant, but she doesn't show much because she isn't that far along and I DID mention it to David a few times, too. This is important. David confessed to Sarah that he lost interest in me, but would still love to be my friend and told Sarah that he liked her instead. Sarah suggested him that he should let me know instead of leading me on and he said that he will talk to me eventually. He never did. He lied to me at the same time that he still liked me, but just wanted to take it slow and start off as friends for now.

It escalated to him inviting us both over, but he never invited me alone. BUT he did try to invite Sarah over on a few occasions, one time even promised to teach her some new things (programming stuff, nothing sexual). She refused though and he slowly took the hint I guess. I should also mention that we walked past his place one day, while Sarah's boyfriend was also along. He was smoking a cigarette and noticed us and came by to have small talk. He seemed pretty shocked when he realized that the guy who was there with us was Sarah's boyfriend and then left shortly after. So after that David just kept talking to me and Sarah on a mutual group chat and invited us both over to watch movies.

Sarah told him that she's not sure if she can make it since she was vomiting all day and he asked her if she was pregnant, seemingly shocked. She asked him if he hadn't heard it from me already and he seemed really shocked, as if he had no idea. But I did mention it to him on several occasions, and David just told Sarah that he didn't remember much or thought it was just a dream. After that he just made some small talk, congratulated her and disappeared. We still ended up going, because we (me and Sarah) bumped into him on the street and he told us we should come anyway. After a while Sarah went home and I decided to stay for a little more while, because I don't live too far from him and I could always walk home. Things took a weird turn after she left, though.

Not going to go into too much detail but he laid down on me and started telling me how he liked me AGAIN and pretty much tried to initiate a hookup. I wasn't feeling it though so it never escalated to it. He also started to kiss me, we did end up making out but it didn't really get much further. I ended up staying over because David kept begging me to. He made me breakfast, I stayed there for a while til I met up with Sarah. And he never said a word to Sarah after that. He did reply to me a bit, but after a while he's been MIA again so I haven't heard nothing from him for 3 days already. He's been ignoring Sarah too.

Also I think it might be worth noting - He works 2 jobs and owns his own company and has kind of a busy life, so in a way I even understand, although before he always managed to find free time and now looks like there's none left, or at least for us. And he has been online, just hasn't read/answered me.

Tl;dr A guy who I met on a dating app led me on, then ghosted me and started to hit on my best friend and after her rejection tried to get with me even though he said he just wanted to be friends with me.

So, any thoughts? I honestly doubt he ever had any true feelings towards me or any of us. I just don't understand what's up and why does he keep lying that he has feelings for me even though he told my best friend Sarah that he lost interest in me and doesn't want to hurt me. Just trying to understand what his motive is, because if he was interested in being friends then why did he ghost us both all of a sudden?"
191,"I(20F) have been dating my boyfriend(21M) for almost 9 months now. Apart from a few, little things that bother me, our relationship is extremely healthy. We spend time together, give each other space to do our own thing, but basically it’s a healthy relationship. The only thing that has been bothering me is his mental health. 
He suffers from PTSD which comes with auditory psychosis. Since I am a psychology student, I have an understanding of both these topics but I haven’t really experienced them first hand with family or friends before, until now. He’s been getting help for his illness and WANTS to get better. His medications have been making him feel worse than he does and I don’t like to see him in pain and want him to get better. 
Another thing that’s bothering me is that he told me that if at any point it gets worse for me, I can leave him. I never even considered this before or ever for that matter. 
What should I do? Has someone dated anyone with a mental illness before? What advice would you give me?"
192,"Me (21f) and my gf (24f) have been together for 3 and a half years. We've had a LOT of ups and downs, the one i want to focus on is she cheated on me 8 months in. Mind you, this was over 2 years ago, but last night i found a letter she had wrote this other girl in 2017. My gf had down played their whole relationship to me, saying that it was a mistake and that she chose me because she loves me. I never questioned it because we've been doing so good the last 2 years and some change. In this letter, my gf had told this other girl that ""she was her soulmate and the other relationship she was in (with me) didn't compare but it was still a bond."" The question I guess I'm asking, isn't if she loves me, because i know she does. But she's never called me her soul mate. She tells me she loves me all the time but that's as deep as she gets with me. Did she settle for me? I don't want to bring it up because she gets mad when i do, but how do i figure out if i was second best to this girl? Is she NOT my soulmate like i thought?"
193,"It's an online relationship, I live in central Europe and she's in Canada. It know how this sounds, but please take this post seriously. I entered this relationship with the mindset of spending my life with her eventually, which is the only time I enter relationships.

First of all, we're both highly monogamous. I have always been this way, been betrayed once but only in a minor way. She, on the other hand, values loyalty the most in a relationship, which made all the more sense when she told me about the ways in which she was betrayed by her past partners. She was always taken advantage of, left for stupid reasons, or just straight up betrayed by selfish and/or heartless people and she has had to go through enough already and doesn't deserve this at all. This has lead her to develop commitment issues. She's afraid of committing to someone again, because too many times in her past this commitment has been let down and/or exploited. I completely understand why she now has this issue, but I seriously care about her and want this to work out in the long run, as such I am ready to work for our future.

According to her, there has not yet been a single partner that was able to do for her what I plan to do for her - to actually stick around and commit myself to her like I personally believe one should stick around and commit in a relationship of the type that I desire, that being a long lasting, serious and healthy monogamous relationship where both partners are equals and treat each other with the respect that comes with that. I know the relationship is still young, as are we, but I have made enough experience in the past to know what people I genuinely love and can fully commit myself to without even a hint of a doubt, she is definitely one of them. Basically, a girl I can imagine living my life with. I've never had close friends or a loving relationship to my parents (with that said, my relationship to my parents is neutral and I do have two really good friends that I engage with a lot and value a lot), and perhaps because of this (or just the way I am, since I've been like this since a being a kid) a romantic relationship has been the most important thing to me, period. I want to do everything in my might to help her and make this work. I fully believe I am able to commit to the extent no one has committed to her before, but I can't possibly count on that alone fixing her commitment issues down the line. I think this is a real, major problem that can't be ignored and I don't trust that me being fully committed and loyal alone will be all it takes to fully fix her issues. It would break my heart to commit to her for years without her being able to overcome her issues eventually.

What can I do for her to help her get rid of the commitment issues? What advice would you give her if she made a post talking about her issues and that she wants to get rid of them? How could she generally be helped by third parties and not just me?

Please do not dismiss us or this post because of our ages. They play a role, but I'm am certain that the same exact scenario could happen between adults even if they have more experience.

Serious advice would be highly appreciated. If you need any more information, I'll try to give you that if necessary, though I can't reveal much more personal things (just ask though and we'll see).

TL;DR: **Girl I recently entered a relationship with has commitment issues due to being betrayed, left and used by a multitude of partners in the past. I am confident in my ability to commit to her for good, but believe that this issue takes more than just that to be fixed. Need advice on what I can do for her and how she can generally be helped.**"
194,"A little background, I (39m) was communicating with escorts on 2 seperate occassions (and exposed myself) but never met with any. I know that doesnt change how i made my wife (38f) feel or change the damage that i caused to her trust and idea of who we are together. I have worked to try and change the behaviours that led me to justify the action and i thought we were doing well, we were married just over a year ago for a total of 10 years together. 

Just before our anniversery, I caught my wife in the early stages if cheating. With my history phones and computers are password free or shared so there are less barriers and more openess, one evening we were sitting down for dinner and her phone buzzed i went to reach for it as i often do to let her knkw who messeaged or what the notification was and she freaked out on me. This was my red flag, i couldnt sleep for 2 nights. On the 2nd night i took her phone and went looking where i found some evidence if her Messaging a gentlemen from her past, i saw a few text messages and a few fbook messages but nothing incriminating other than an intent to meet up with this guy. I confronted her and we have been working on things. She said it was harmless flirting, nothing serious, and she said she blocked the guy and unfriended him because she didnt want to be that girl.

As you can imagine i am a little paranoid, some nights i do not sleep and i try to trust she is honest with me but last night i couldnt sleep and i went diggin. I found out that she didnt block this guy like she said she did. She has nude pics that were never sent to me so i can only assume that they went somewhere, not to this specific guy but somewhere....

How or should i even try to approach this?? Do i wait and hope she opens up about it or confront her? I am afraid that nl matter what effort she puts into rebuilding if she never tells me i will never trust her and if i confront her i have taken away the potential for her to be fully honest with me. Looking for open honest advice......"
195,"Hi reddit. I mostly lurk but I’m a little down in the dumps about my relationship. I’m honestly being a bit of a baby about this and I know it needs a conversation, I’m just not sure where to start or how to approach it because this is very new to me. 


For context: my partner and I have been dating for three years, and just moved in together five months ago. This is my first time living on my own and with a partner, this is his first time living with someone in a LTR. I’m currently feeling under appreciated and not acknowledged. There are several things feeding into this and it could just be a now thing and due to the change in our living situation. 


For starters, he has a full time job and I have a part time job while finishing an advanced degree. We split bills 50/50. He does the bulk of cooking while I do the bulk of cleaning, but on big chore days he pitches in and meal prep days I pitch in. If I wake up and have breakfast with him he makes it for us both and if I’m home for dinner he’ll make it for us both. He works a 9-5 that often has him stay late, and my job as a server kind of flings me around, so I’m not always able to share meals with him. If we’ve meal prepped something for dinner we usually eat that, if not toss together a bake or stir fry or pasta quick dish usually. Otherwise meals are at our discretion. Big chore days usually include mopping, vacuuming, and mutual laundry (towels, bedding). I do the rest of the upkeep. 


Since moving in together we tend not to text as much (which makes sense) as we see each other every day rather than every other day. Usually in text conversations we’d ask how each other was doing, how was the day, etc. Most conversations are now held in person. 


Recently I’ve noticed that he doesn’t ask me how I’m doing/how was my day in person or thru text. He just tells me what he’s doing etc, often unprompted but I tend to ask questions after, follow up, and so on. He rarely asks about my day at all and I get that school and serving are kind of par for the course and unchanging, it just makes me feel like he’s uninterested in me and my life. The minutia of it. Additionally I always thank him for cooking/preparing meals and doing things around the house because I’m super appreciative of it! He’s the better more experienced cook! It’s great! But he never really acknowledges what I do around the house. I did a huge deep clean yesterday, did most of the big chores and cleaning myself, because he mentioned he was feeling kind of terrible and down and overall bleh. I had a lot of time before work so I thought it would be nice for him to come home to a clean space. He didn’t bring it up. I brought up what I did yesterday this morning over breakfast and he said he had noticed. But nothing after that. It kind of hurt. 


How much of this is just regular adult life and managing my expectations? I usually don’t clean to make him happy or anything, I clean because it’s my living space too and I don’t like dirt. If anything, I’m the messier one that has a lower standard of cleanliness (except for the bathroom). He’s under some stress and has had a few rough days recently, but the pattern has be ongoing for a month+. I just want to feel like he’s interested in me still. 

TL;DR: How do I talk about feeling under appreciated when it could just be regular adult things and normal stuff with living together? I don’t want resentment to grow :("
196,the guy I like is playing hot and cold with me. one minute he's saying we'll be together soon the next he's saying if you meet someone else I won't stop you and if I meet someone else don't stop me. can someone please clarify what's going on?
197,"This morning we got into it. Lately our sex life has been dull. Nightly, I try to have sex. Ideally, we would have sex nightly. I get denied 9/10 times. 

He said I make him feel bad when I ask things after he denies me like “Could we have sex tomorrow?” since he often complains that I throw it on him last second right before he’s about to fall asleep. He feels bad when we don’t have sex and I decide that if I’m not having sex I might as well just go to sleep, so I roll over. Apparently that drives him insane. 

He often makes sex feel like something he HAS to do. Not a want. We’ll have sex and then afterwards he will say things like “yeah I owe it to you” or something after I say it was good or whatever. So not only are we not having sex, I feel like a chore when we finally do have sex. 

This morning, I tried explaining to him that I just want him to want me and not want me because he feels like he’s obligated to. The last thing I want is for sex to feel like an obligation rather than a want. 

He got frustrated “you want to have sex everyday, multiple times a day!” Which isn’t at all what I was saying. Once a day would be fucking fantastic but we’re adults. That can’t always happen. However, I did say I’d rather not go 4 or 5 days without like we have been. 

What’s frustrating to me is that for the past 4 days he’s woken up and basically promised me sex that doesn’t happen which is misleading to me. 

Now it’s been 4 days and he’s worried because he feels pressure since it’s been 4 days. “You put me on a timeline.” 


Historically, we’ve been very sexually active never really had problems clicking. It’s not like I’m some sexual deviant and I’ve been just taking care of myself in the interim but I don’t know what to do. 

Now he feels insufficient. I just want to feel wanted/sexy. Is it his age? Is this common for men around their 30s? I really don’t feel like somewhat regular sex is this absurd ask after 4 years. 

I’ve decided I’m going to just stop asking and trying to have sex for awhile. I just feel like if he wanted to, we’d be having sex.

Edit; 

TLDR: sex hasn’t been happening lately, I make him feel bad when I want to have sex, our lack of sex makes me feel unwanted/unattractive. What do?"
198,"I got to know this girl through one of my close friends about a year and half ago when we all were in college. They were living together but were not in a relationship after she had broken up with her previous boyfriend for this guy. I'm mostly a reserved guy and don't talk to anyone until the OP initiates it. Things weren't good between my friend and that girl when I got to know her. I didn't talk much with her and was just an acquaintance. She started to hang out with us a lot due to my guy friend.
A few months later, the college was over, and all the hanging out reduced a lot. She started texting me in a friendly kinda way, like to talk about our group plans or to decide on the meeting spot.
The texting increased a lot over a period of a few weeks. We became good friends. She used to tell about everything going on in her everyday life. She slowly started talking about her worries, about how things are very bad between her and my friend. She even told me one or two of her secrets that none of her friends know about. She always wanted to talk with me, she always forced me to go out with the group of our mutual friends whenever I didn't feel like going. She even got pissed with me when I started texting her female friend (just talking, no flirting or anything) and we even argued about that because she has a lot of guy friends, a lot, and I didn't like it when she tried to control who I talk with because all along I had considered her as a friend and nothing more. We were emotionally attached.
It was all good until a month or so when she suddenly reduced the talking. I asked her if I had done something wrong but she said no and I didn't bother much. The worst thing happened on her birthday, she had invited her guy friends who were spoiling the whole vibe. Most of them were drunk including her. I arrived late along with my friend (the guy who was with her) and were annoyed and started to leave but she convinced us not to. Later my friend and she got into an argument, and even I said some things later which ended up with her crying on her birthday. Even now I apologise her for that.
She accepted my apology and everything was okay for a few weeks after which she suddenly started ignoring me. By this time, I used to like her a lot and was even thinking of telling that to her (she was not with my friend anymore) if things were back to normal. But it just got worse. I told her that I was feeling bad with all this ignoring and to tell me what was wrong or if she doesn't want to talk, that's okay with me, because it's better than being ignored. She just kept pushing away the topic. It just kept getting worse and worse and I just felt more and more like shit. We rarely even talked.

After a long time, eventually we started talking again. And after some time, I told her that I liked her and wanted us to be more than friends. She turned me down saying that she wasn't looking for a relationship right now and I told that it was okay, no worries (I was broken because it was the first time I had liked a girl enough to confess it to her)
I told her that I don't want to be friends with her anymore because it might be awkward, she didn't agree with not being friends part but I cut off all communications. She later on contacted me through a mutual friend of ours, I felt guilty and finally after a lot of talking agreed to be friends again.
This is getting long, I'll tell the rest of the story in short.
After just a month, she started dating some guy and it didn't work out. Then after 2-3 months, she started dating another guy and this got serious. At the same time she started ignoring me again, I told her that it made me feel bad but she just denied doing anything. She was good with all our other friends. It just got worse and worse. Finally I told her that I couldn't take it anymore and I didn't wanted to be friends with her or talk anymore.
She didn't protest much.
I somehow managed to not think about it and kept myself busy. But my friend (her ex) came back into the picture, she left the new guy for him, thinking it might work this time but it didn't go anywhere and he left the country for higher studies. Before he left, all of us friends started meeting a lot and even she used to be there, so a hey, bye, small talk was not avoidable in front of our friends. She started talking again and I told her I don't want to, and said some mean things to her in the heat of the moment, she apologized for ignoring saying that she had found someone who she wanted to be with, and that she wasn't talking to most of her friends (which is not true) but gave that up because she madly loves her ex(my friend) even though she knows that it's not going to work out. Now that he's gone away and she can't stop thinking about him and that I was her closest friend with whom she could talk about stuff like these. She literally cried. I didn't think it was right to leave her in that state, so consoled her everyday for a few days,and we were back to talking and being friends. We are not like we were before, but okayish. I have fallen for her all over again and trying to ward off that thought by giving all possible reasons, but not able to. She's always on my mind.
But she has again started the ignoring, but very subtle,she talks to me if she wants to know about something and also some small talk almost everyday.  I think she has started dating again. She talks as if everything is normal and she's not doing anything. Even if I stop being friends with her, she eventually comes back in,and we have mutual friends which makes it impossible to avoid her completely. I'm very hurt, confused and couldn't concentrate on anything. On top of that I couldn't stop thinking about her. I haven't cared this much about anyone. I don't want to tell her again that I want to stop being friends.
Please tell me what to do.

EDIT: If this makes any difference, I've never been in a relationship before due to certain reasons. Had to turn a blind eye even to those few who showed interest in me. I'm now ready to explore the dating world but with no knowledge to do it.
The girl has been with many guys, relationships and flings. So, she has a lot of experience in these kinda stuff."
199,So before I started dating my boyfriend I used to cam for money. I stopped this before we started dating but I’ve been thinking about starting it up again because I need the money. My boyfriend is a marine stationed overseas and I don’t want him to be mad but I really need the money. I already work 2 “normal” jobs so don’t judge me. Please help
200,"So a few weeks ago I logged into an anonymous App, whisper,  and met a girl who was fun to talk too and we got to the topic of hooking up and all. We flirted and then asked her to meet. I was completely cat-fished. We kissed and I asked her to go down on me. She hesitated because she was nervous and all. She did it for a bit. 

I didn’t feel comfortable with her being very very different than the photos she shared. But asked me what I thought and told her she was cute, I was just being polite. I then ghosted her. 

Then after a few weeks later she says she wants to hook up again and ignore her. Then she messages me saying “If she was a crazy bitch I would have message ****** ( wife’s name) already. Just in case you ever wanna cheat on your wife again”. 

I asked her what she means and she said that why did I play her like that. She knew my situation and all I wanted was a hook up. 

What should I do?"
201,"Went out with a girl in july-august who’s emotionally unavailable and unstable. First we were dating and she was really into it/me but as time went by she started distancing herself romance wise. wouldn’t kiss me and flirt back with me and she said it leads back to failed relationships in the past and current issues like daddy issues/focusing on working/herself, mostly.

We had a bit of push and pulls where i would convince her to go out on dates with me but by october she has emotionally detached herself from getting into a relationship. we were still talking all the time because she said she doesn’t wanna lose me but she simply can’t reciprocate so we were at a standstill. 
she said all she needs right now are good platonic friends and she says it sucks that she can’t push herself to have feelings for me, or anyone. and suggested we rather stay friends. but i rejected it because i have simply went in too deep with this woman.

Now i know the case that if she isn’t ready i’m supposed to back off a little. we actually haven’t been talking for a couple weeks now but we’re still on social media a lot so i keep track of her.
She said it’s best if i moved on and dated someone else who’s reciprocating what i give, which i have but it just doesn’t feel the same. i think about her all the time. 

She on the other hand is upset because i can geniuinely say she’s into me, she enjoys being around me and tells me everything about her day, although she’s apparently someone who doesn’t open up alot, i’m that one person she opens up to. And i’m just someone she doesn’t wanna lose having around.
When i told her to come back to me when she’s ready, she simply replied with ‘I know how to find you.’

I’m currently at the mindset of waiting it out with this person because i think this is something that can really last. we make each other laugh and we have a great time everytime we’re together. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has advise for me, moving on is definitely the number one course of action but i’m simply hooked to this woman. 
How would y’all proceed if you were in my shoes, or has this happened to anyone here before, do you think she’ll come back to me? or do you think she’s just not that into me?
i would appreciate different perspectives on this. 

Thank you so much.

202,"Both mid thirties and been together ten years.

For the first few years we were together we had what I would consider a lot of sex. A few years in she was forced to switch birth control pills (on them due to severely debilitating periods) and her sex drive went off a cliff, this was noted as one of the potential side effects of this particular pill. 

She started making excuses about why we couldn't have sex and when we did do it she treated it like a chore that she had to get out of the way rather than something she wanted to do. I felt pretty unwanted and tried talking to her about it and didn't get anywhere. I felt I was somehow perverted or abnormal for getting upset about it because other than that our relationship is fanastic.

Earlier this she said she wanted to come off her birth control and try for a baby at the end of summer, which she has done. She's super excited about the whole thing, talking about baby clothes tracking fertility etc.

But we still aren't having a lot of sex. It's pretty much a numbers game and last time she was in a fertile week we did it once. If she wasn't so excited I'd think she had changed her mind. At the same time in starting to wonder if she just doesn't like having sex with me and should I reconsider having a baby with her and ending up being permanently tied to someone who doesn't see me as a romantic partner.

She clams up when I try to discuss anything like this and I struggle to get a sensible answer out of her. How  do I fix this?"
203,I’ve been in a relationship for about 7/8 months now with a man who is several (15+) years older than him. I’ve done everything to try and rekindle how I used to feel about him for about a month. I cry every moment I start thinking about breaking up with him. I tried about a week ago and it broke him so much that I wanted to fix things. I want things to change. I arranged a surprise birthday party for him with all his family in two weeks. But it feels like nothing he doesn’t is never enough for me. He’s sweet and loving and kinder to me than any of my other boyfriends have ever been but there’s no motivation or drive. We have nothing to talk about anymore because he doesn’t do anything. He’s relying on me to be his pride and joy. I feel so pressured that it’s eating me alive. It’s hurting my work. It’s hurting my health. It’s killed my confidence and self esteem. But I can’t do it. I can’t hurt him again. I can’t see his face be so in pain because of me.
204,"24F) have been feeling extremely emotional lately about my bf(29). We have been together for about 2 years and it had been pretty great, but unfortunately his dad got ill from cancer and passed. He started changing and becoming mean and stopped wanting to converse. We decided to split because we both realized that it wasn't working because he just couldn't ""feel"" anymore. I still was there for him and checked up on him every now and then because I knew he was depressed. A few months later and we end up dating again because he said I was the only thing that made him happy. Now he does his best and tries to come over and show me his happy side, but I can tell he is extremely tired. On his days off he works on remodeling his house but doesn't message me at all. Sometimes it's 3 days and 4 replies from him. Then when it gets closer to his work days he is responsive and comes and sleeps over to spend time with me. He was my boss from my old employer so I admit that I have always been a little insecure because we have always been a secret from friends and coworkers. I still work in the industry so we still are a secret to this day. I trust him but he is very popular with the girls at work and is friendly &amp; nice so my imagination runs wild. I blow up on him and then I feel so bad because I know he is going through it with his dad's passing. I am so tired of being crazy! What can I do??? 

TLDR. Dating my boss and insecure before &amp;after we have a  break up due to depression about his dad. We get back together and dont talk as much and I feel bad for being crazy gf when I know he is having a hard time. How can I get over this???

Sorry if a lot of it is irrelevant, i am not good at writing on topic"
205,"So I just started seeing this guy and we have mad chemistry and connection but hes not really ready for another relationship quite yet (I'm unsure If i am even) but he seems to be genuine about only seeing me right now, I'm curious if this relationship will now be stuck in this in between zone or if in a month or 2 theres potential for growth from anyone's personal experience"
206,"I was introduced to someone vastly different than I was and we started dating despite our differences. He showed a lot of red flags early on. He was edgy, lashed out, and blamed  me for his outbursts etc. after the first time we met he started acting jealous and possessive of me. He said “I made him so crazy” and that was the reason for his outburst. He charmed his way through the red flags and I stayed. I was finishing nursing school at the time and liked having someone to hang out with. I have poor relationships with both of my parents. He has always rubbed me the wrong way, he makes racial slurs and talks poorly about women and in general is just a negative, childish person. 

We have bonded over some mutual toxicity. His mommy issues resonate with my daddy issues. He is mistrusting of women and I am wary of men. We both needed someone. 

I tried to break up with him when I learned he was taking a road trip to another state to buy weed to bring back home to sell. I told him I thought we wanted different things in life and couldn’t make it work. He turned on the charm, did some gaslighting about how it wasn’t even a big deal and I was overthinking it. And I stayed. 

He got arrested during this trip. I felt compelled to be there for him through these hard times. I don’t know why I felt like I couldn’t leave. 

We broke up for 9 days. I cried so much. I felt so alone. I was so angry at how he has treated me but also felt so badly for hurting him. I was alone. He was surrounded by him wonderful, supportive family who know nothing or his abusive ways. He’s one of those guys who is perfect in public and around others. But is so insecure when we are at home and lashes out at me. I think his mom knows, based on comments she has made to me, but she lives in la la land and would never admit that to anyone. Basically, I’d just look like the asshole to these people. 

Fast forward, I got pregnant and we now live together and have a daughter. He is such a good dad, truly. He takes good care of her, wakes up with her and we do the best we can to make things work.  He is so selfish as childish. I would hate for our daughter to pick up on his negative traits or worse... use how he treats me as her standard of what to look for in a man. An example: Our most recent fight revolved around him saying he doesnt get enough blow jobs and feels unappreciated and that he does everything.   He I just a self centered pig with WILD ideas of what is normal in a relationship or how to speak to your significant other. He is also a very unhealthy communicator. 

I work nights then come home and take care of our daughter during the day while he works and everything else around the house and we split all bills 50/50. He genuinely gets delusional and screams at me during every fight that he does everything and I take him for granted, which is bewildering. Everything comes out of my bank account and I essentially invoice him every month for his half of the bills. I do the chores around the house and he chips in when I delegate to him. I pick up groceries and all baby related items. Otherwise our home would be a pig sty.

I have a good job but a lot of student loan debt and live in a very expensive area. I can’t afford to live on my own at this time. I could move in with my mom but she has narcissistic/borderline personality disorder and it’s bad for me to be around her. 

He has a video of me on his cell phone where I was drunk during a fight and I threw a book at his phone so he would stop recording me. He choked me after this incident and threw me on the ground and said he would use the video against me to get custody of our daughter and any complaint of him choking me would be dismissed because it was self defense. 

I’m not sure how he could get custody, seeing as he has an under the table job and has never paid taxes, has no proof of income, and has never had stability or provided for himself. He is currently on probation for a drug related felony. I have absolutely no criminal history, a positive academic record and very solid job history, credit score, etc. 

I’m not an angel in our relationship. I have been to a lot of therapy to learn to communicate and express myself. He has learned a few things as well but his temper gets the most of him. He doesn’t hold back and really just doesn’t even try to control himself. If you’ve made it this far, thank you. I just really need some advice. It’s getting worse and I am afraid of my future with him. 

TLDR: I need to escape an emotionally, physically and sexually abusive relationship. Average rent is $1500 in my area and I have big student loan payments monthly. Any ideas or advice would be rad. Thank you."
207,I really wanna ask out this girl. She’s a senior and I’m a junior. I wanna take her to a party called “fright nights” and it’s at a fairground. I only see her in my second period. How should I go about asking her out?
208,M20 F 21 ...The girl I've been seeing just ended things cause my online profile said i was 22 but it was a misunderstanding i didnt know that was the age there what to do ?
209,"I've been interested in a girl for quite a while. We're very good friends, and have gotten much closer over the past few months, in group settings and one on one. 

She broke up with her ex over a communication issue at the beginning of summer, but wanted to remain on speaking terms since she has to interact with him on a regular basis. They only went out for a few months anyways. This went fine for a while, but over the course of the last month he's been a real ass to her, caused lots of drama in their circle of mutual friends, fucked several of her mutual friends, etc. She's talking about how she never wants him in her apartment for get-togethers again, would absolutely never consider dating him again, how badly she fucked up dating him in the first place, etc. I got to be her confidant for most of the ranting and complaining about him.

Aside from that she's been having a rough time with family, which gave me plenty of opportunities to break the touch barrier and rub her back, touch her thigh, neck, etc. She noticed this and called me out on it, asking me if I was into her. I told her yes, which surprised her. Turns out she's thought I was attractive from the beginning, and likes me back. Great! We flirted for the next three weeks or so, and I wanted to give her some space and time to calm down about the drama in her life before making any sort of move. I want a relationship with this girl, not just a quick fling. 

After basically everyone he knows telling him he was being an asshole, the ex chilled out a bit, apologized, and was back on speaking terms with her. Things were still going well on my side of things, flirting was escalating a little bit. 

Then out of nowhere she's going to a friend's birthday party with her ex, they're acting like there's nothing out of the ordinary about this, and several days later they're back together. 

\*Pikachu Face* 

So.... at this point I'm not sure my best course of action to try and swing things back in my favor. Chances are things won't last with her ex just like they didn't the first time, and she's explicitly told me that she's into me, that I make her happy, and she likes spending time with me. She still asks me to go do things with her and our mutual friends as well. 

We have tons of common interests, hobbies, goals, everything, honestly. 

Does anyone have any advice for how I can really hook this girl in and get her interested enough to not be her second choice next time?"
210,"We started dating three months ago, and I've never been with a more beautiful, intelligent, and funny person. We have so many things in common - like our love of music, art, and an analytical, sensitive orientation to the world. I haven't had a connection this deep with another person in so long. When we would hang out, I felt so happy and comforted.

But things could be far from perfect in between those moments. My ex has CPTSD and difficulty communicating their emotions. In the beginning, as we warmed to each others' communication styles, they would often shut me out or get triggered by seemingly innocent things I would say (compliments, devaluing their emotions, etc.). Sometimes they'd say cold, analytical, hurtful things towards me about my intentions or how I came across. Essentially, we could never compromise or agree during any misunderstanding - their emotional realization of the situation always was more important than mine. I took great offense to this at first, because I guess no one likes to be wrong and also because I grew up in an abusive environment and I constantly feel a need for approval/a responsibility for others' feelings. It was refreshing, then, to have her tell me that only they could work through their feelings on their own.

And I feel like they made a genuine effort to communicate to me their thoughts and emotional processes whenever they would act out. But it was still difficult, with no real signs of improving. Something as simple as me going out with my friends, being too tired to come over, or even texting them *too much* could come off as disingenuous or as an intimation that I didn't care about them. They also felt sometimes like I was acting ""according to a script"" (to be fair, it's hard walking on eggshells around somebody 24/7) and that I had difficulty communicating my feelings.

It's only because, at least early on, communicating my feelings would sometimes cause them to stonewall me or to tell me I seemed manipulative (even if that wasn't my intention).

Still, they tried. They really tried, for me, and they say they genuinely like me and care about me in a way that they haven't felt before. Yet through it all, and I guess this makes me a jerk, I was complaining behind her back to my friends about how unreasonable many of her reactions were. And how it felt like we weren't building a foundation of trust, of progress.

So I finally managed to break it off, albeit in a very wishy washy way, by communicating that I felt resentful and under appreciated. I stayed over last night and they seemed so happy to see me, so intent on things improving for the better. We cuddled and talked for hours, and played card games, and they seemed more receptive to my needs than ever. But I couldn't help myself, and I continued to press the point that I didn't see much of a future with them. Rather than talking about it, they asked if we could ""just go to sleep,"" and so we slept on opposite sides of the bed without discussing anything. This morning, we broke up.

I feel so much regret over my emotional immaturity, and how I slow-walked this. I've never had a completely healthy relationship, and so my notions as to what stability ""should be"" like feel murky and maybe I've just been making it deliberately harder than it should be. Maybe I have trust issues. In the end, I'm not sure if I have the emotional strength to help someone with CPTSD and who can't really apologize or be accountable for their freakouts. And that's fine. But I feel like they gave me everything, and I was a jerk about it all for no reason. Was it intuition? Was it my own issues? I don't know, and now I want her back.

**TL;DR:** Felt unable to support girlfriend's CPTSD/trauma/dissociation, and we broke up. I feel bad about this, because they seemed to be really trying for me, and I have no understanding of or justification for my feelings of resentment and uncertainty. Do you think my intuition was correct? Should I try to reconcile with her?"
211,"Hey all,

I'm together with my girlfriend for about 6 years. Everything is kinda fine except our sex life and our communication - most of the time both of us don't say what we really want and rather do what we assume the other wants (be that going out eating, spending free time, ..). We are working on that and it slowly gets better.

What's not getting better is our sex life - the first few times when we had sex everything was fine, but it didn't really click. Both of us didn't feel that much (because of protection? Idk). She straight up told me she doesn't like the look of a penis and will never go for oral or anal - I told her that I won't pressure her into something that she doesn't want.

About 2 years into our relationship she suddenly started to fear getting pregnant, even though she is on birth control and we are using condoms. Every once in a while we try to have sex again, but after having to open the 4th condom to show her that there is no sperm on my hands and her still being uncomfortable I'm really not in the mood anymore. For the last 5 years, we probably had sex less than 30 times - most of the time we are grinding if there is even more than kissing. 

I honestly don't know what to do - every time I talked with her about this being a problem for me she feels bad and pressured. She is seeking a therapist because of her fears, but she has been there for the last 3 years and even though we manage to talk about more, nothing really changes. At this point, I feel stuck between talking with her and nothing changing because of the topic pressuring her and not doing anything at all which also doesn't lead to anything. 

Our relationship doesn't feel like we are in love with each other, more like best friends sharing a flat and I rarely get aroused anymore. I tried not pressuring her for the last years, but it didn't get me anywhere. I am frustrated and don't know how to approach her or the topic."
212,"My boyfriend and I have been on rocky terms. He’s been busy with moving, finding a new job while still suffering at his current one and attempting to go back to school. In the beginning we spent a lot of time together maybe 4 days a week but I always told him it was okay to stay home if he had other things to do. Long story short, we kept fighting because he’d ignore my advice and end up being stressed out and not really talk to me about it. We started talking less, seeing each other less and fighting more. We haven’t been intimate in weeks either. And eventually he would just forget he made plans with me and I wouldn’t hear from him all day. 

Last week he said he needed to take a step back because of his busy life right now. So we agreed less time together and not talking all day was okay. I only asked that he communicate with me when he can’t make it. Saturday I planned this whole day for him, he told me he’d spend the night but by the time we were driving home he has to help his roommate. We were messing around before he left but never had sex, he came and left maybe 30 minutes later. It hurt my feelings because it felt one sided and he hasn’t been as verbally affectionate so I asked about it but he said his feelings haven’t changed. He promised to come over the next afternoon but of course he forgot and I heard nothing from him the next day. 

I got upset and tried to explain why. I held up my side of what I’d change but he just forgot again. We had been texting about it all day and he asked if he could come over the next day to talk about it in person. I told him I didn’t want to have the conversation anymore and just forget it. The next afternoon he wished me a good day and I did the same but haven’t heard anything from him since and it’s been 3 days. I’m tired of being the person putting in all the effort and having to reach out to hear anything from him. He never apologized for standing me up either and I just feel like he doesn’t respect me or my time. I’ve been trying to just wait and give him space but this just isn’t like us at all and I don’t know what to do. I miss him and I want to talk to him but I always do and I’ve been feeling like he never does. Maybe I’m being stubborn but should I just reach out to him again?"
213,"**This part is very important: Please, please keep things civil, I recognize this title could be considered inflammatory but I will describe the situation as objectively as possible given the limited information I have. I will not include any of my own opinions for clarity.**

This situation occurred just yesterday at my college, where I found my friend in a great deal of stress and panic over events that happened hours earlier, who then recounted the events from her perspective. It started when she was having a discussion with a regular member of the Black Student Union (BSU). She was curious about the organization, but she asked whether non-black students were allowed to participate, because nowhere in print (flyers, school website, etc.) did the BSU's description explicitly state so. This was question was not taken lightly by the BSU member she was talking with. She had also wondered aloud why other ethnic-based student organizations didn't exist on campus, specifically mentioning Latino and Islamic as examples that would represent other demographics within the student body. At this point, she believes the BSU member assumed she was actually referring to white students, because then they started yelling at her. (My friend is about half Native American)

While this was happening, another BSU member who was nearby started recording the conversation on their phone. My friend is upset because she was not aware it was happening, and ""did not consent to being recorded"" (verbatim). By the time she was aware of a recording, it was because the 2nd BSU member had left and already ""shared parts of the conversation out of context, and added their personal judgments"" (verbatim) with many other members of the BSU, who all in turn came to make angry remarks at her, including accusations of racism. Despite her asking to see it, the BSU members have refused to share this recording with non-members, so the only other information available about the recorded conversation is her testimony.

Finally, word of this situation got to the head of the Student Activities Office, a student faculty member who is also a member of the BSU, who then sided with their views, even though she tried to explain herself and apologize. This student faculty member then demanded she and one other person who was there at the time to defend her to attend the next BSU meeting, and apparently made some sort of threat against them pertaining to their academic standing if they refused. In her words, if she didn't go, ""she had better pack up her things and find a different school to take her classes.""

My friend is extremely anxious and worried because of this upcoming meeting, as she feels like being forced to interact with \~30 students who have a clear grudge against her and this one other student is not the safest thing to do because of emotions running high and the likelihood she will be unable to speak for herself in that environment.

What should she do in this situation? Is she actually obligated to go, or was the student faculty member overstepping their authority? How can she get her points across to and attempt to make peace with a fairly large group of people who have already rejected her words and allegedly subscribe to each other's biases against her? Are the actions taken by both groups lawful, or could she make a case for harassment? Maybe she chose her words at the time poorly enough that she needs to just face up and accept whatever may happen at this meeting?"
214,"I’m just looking for tips on finding the confidence on talking to someone in person for the first time.

        Some context, I’m a high school senior 17m and have been in multiple relationships before, but with girls I had previously known or had been friends with. Recently I’ve had a absolutely massive crush on an sophomore girl 16 who’s really interesting and incredibly attractive. She’s not too far out of my league however. But I’ve never talked to her in person, just short conversations over Snapchat so in theory I shouldn’t be nervous to approach her, especially because I’ve been in other relationships before. The only time I see her is when she passes by quickly in the halls and by the time I notice her shes already past me. I haven’t been able to find a moment besides those quick seconds in the hall and I just find it awkward to just try to stop her and talk especially because I wouldn’t have anything to talk about at that moment. I don’t know why I’m so nervous to talk to her I’m normally very social but I think its because I don’t really know her at all and I’ve never had to deal with that. 
        So I’m just asking for some tips on how to find a second to talk, what to say and especially how to escape the incredibly powerful panic mode I go into when I see her."
215,"Hello random strangers on the internet,

I am 20, M, and in a long distance relationship for 2 years this week. I know this girl from childhood and she's perfect, I love her a lot and can't help but imagine a future with her. The problem is the distance. We both are in colleges completing our bachelor degrees (in different cities) and very unsure about our future plans. I might move abroad for a job or higher studies (a lot of guys in my college do) and she might do something similar. The odds of us landing up in the same city seems very low, so right now it feels like an LDR with no end in sight.

And I am not okay with it at all. It's leading to problems between us as well recently, just cuz of the fact that we don't get to see each other as often. A 4 day trip to her city can cost me as much as 300 dollars and I can't shell out that kind of money very often. We spend approx 20 days together in a year and i have just grown frustrated of the distance. We talk on call everyday and keep each other as involved in each others lives as possible, and I feel very happy indeed when we do get to see other. I just don't know how long I can go on like this. 

I have, in my 3 years in college, found myself being fascinated with a lot of girls. It was a crush, I never acted on it and I always got over it. But it kills me to know that I will never have a normal college relationship, where I am actually with the person I am with. And I won't have it when I start working either if we continue like this. 

I am frustrated and confused and very unsure of what to do. I know a break up would mean me losing out on a great girl who loves me a lot, and it would kill me if she ever starts dating someone else. At the same time, I don't know if this LDR without an end in sight is sustainable, and I don't want to do something I end up regretting, or cheat, just because I dont have the courage to break up. I have judged cheaters all my life. But I can't shake the feeling that I am wasting my 20s by settling for 20 days a year, even if my SO is a great girl. I wonder what you would have done in this situation."
216," So I have this girl..who I'm inlove with for like 4 months..We had fond memories of friendship and laughs..And made ourselves comfortable for each other..and became so close..like we frequently call or video chat each other after school..So I come up with the conclusion that..we aren't friends it's something else..Maybe like lovers..I gave her gifts on her birthday..andddd this is my problem..the girl had history with this guy for like a year or so..and the guy is into her..eversince..and they have a relationship but it isn't labeled..because the girl doesn't want to commit to him but I really think they like each other....but what about me..theres already build up for us..but the guy is pushing me back..Girl knows I like her..and she's letting me love her ..even though she has a relationship with this guy..Thats really hurting for me knowing that the guy is inlove and had moments with this girl at the same time as me being with her..I really want to let go..because it is really hurting me with jealousy and the feeling of not being enough for her...I think that I really can't be with her..because of that guy but..I don't want to leave..the girl because it will end up just hurting her...we decided to become only friends but it's not working..we both know were beyond that..But it's this guy...who's keeps pushing me back.. I really want to let go..because it's really hurting me for the past few months knowing that they had history , have a unlabeled relationship , and still having fun of each other's comfort...so she's a two timer I guess...What should I do ? What should I consider? What are the consequences? Please I really need an advice and help.. :&lt;&lt;"
217,"TL;DR at the bottom. I'll try to keep this as short as possible. My husband and I have been struggling for about 2 years now (together 11 years, married for 3). Over the past two years my husband has become emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and he is also an alcoholic (although, he says that he doesn't have a problem). I've been trying to work with him and work through things but nothing ever seems to change. Some examples of behaviors are: when drinking he often finds ways to engage with me and intentionally push my buttons to try to make me mad. So even if i try to avoid him he'll find where I'm at and start asking me questions or accusing me of things. He will end up making himself upset which then leads to him speaking to me horribly, saying things like he hates me, i'm ugly or fat, no one likes me, i have an attitude problem, he should cheat on me, i'm a bitch...etc. He drinks regularly, beer and liquor. He often will accuse me of giving him dirty looks. This is any time I walk into a room that he is in. He has never hit me, but his most recent explosive episode caused me to feel fear. He was very aggressive and constantly would get in my face and point at me while yelling. I couldn't get away from him. He regularly drinks and drives. He has been arrested once. When he gets angry or in one of his moods he will ignore/be cold to me and our son (my bio son, but he has been in the picture since 10 months old). He will shirk out on his responsibilities and tell me that he is 'my' son and he shouldn't have to drive him places or stuff. He often accuses me of using him for his money. He micromanages my spending even though he can purchase whatever he wants whenever he wants (important to note that we live VERY comfortably, we both work full time- i actually have a second job for 'spending money' and I have hobbies that bring in a little income. We both have higher education degrees, and before we got married I supported myself and my son financially very comfortably. He does make more, but we both bring money to the table). I can come home from the grocery store (after previously discussing with him what I'm going to get) and he will still get on me about how much I've spent. He often, when angry, will threaten to divorce me and/or cheat on me. He will then ask me to convince him that he should stay with me. He tells me I'm not meeting his sexual needs (and at this point that is true- about 6 months ago I decided, for my own health and well-being, that I couldn't continue to be intimate with him. I would cry during and after because his expectations were so difficult to meet), he then tries to justify him going elsewhere to get them met, he says it will benefit me because then he won't ask me for anything. Most recently I caught him searching and speaking with a woman on social media, come to find out this is the same woman he cheated on me with about 5 years ago. I also caught him speaking to people on Reddit asking about certain sexual situations that he used to engage in ( also cheating, about 5 years ago- however i just found out about it now). I often feel crazy because from the outside our relationship doesn't look horrible. Only recently have our close friends began to witness some of his behaviors. Our life isn't always horrible, we will have good days too. However, at this point in our relationship I pretty much just avoid interaction with him so as not to make him angry. I was in counseling for about 6 months at the beginning of the year, and i finally, after much convincing, got him to go with me for about 2 months. He then decided it wasn't helping and he didn't want to go anymore. So every time in the past that I've told him things need to change he changes for a day, a week, a month.. but ultimately things always go back to how they were. I finally got the courage to request a separation, which he was on board with and then after a couple hours his behavior changed and he wanted to spend time with me, he wanted to take me on a date night, he was speaking to me kindly, he started sleeping in our bed again.. I'm angry, i think. I'm struggling with the hope that his behavior can ever change long term. I struggle with feeling guilty for wanting to leave (i come from a religious family who discourage divorce).My questions are: Is this behavior manipulative? Am I over-reacting or is my request for separation justified? How do I stick to my guns? Any and all advice is welcome. 

tl;dr: I feel like my husband is manipulative and abusive. After requesting a separation husbands behavior changed for the better. How long do I stay? Am I crazy and overreacting? Am I justified in my feelings. I don't feel like I have an objective opinion of the situation. HELP PLEASE."
218,"I struggle with depression and anxiety and have for a long time. After therapy, antidepressants, anxiety meds, diet, exercise... I either suffered bad side effects or they just didn’t work for me. A few years back I decided to basically ride out the lows and that’s how I’ve been living ever since. After quite a few failed relationships I decided serious relationships were not for me as my mental health can really stress and wear on my partners. 
Fast forward and I meet a guy and we begin casually talking. I explain many times in many ways that I am focusing on myself and not looking for a relationship. He persists, pleads, essentially begs. I give it a shot and now we’ve been together about a year. I love him, I do. He is my best friend. But over time my instability has started to break down the relationship. 
While I know I am not the *only* issue, I am the biggest. As many times as I’ve tried to explain to him the low place that I am in he just doesn’t get it. He gets upset and takes it personally and I don’t blame him. But he also gets frustrated and backs me into a corner when I tell him I don’t want to talk to right now or I need time to process how I’m feeling. That triggers a fight and that’s what’s really killing us. 
I don’t know what to do, really. I want to cut him loose.  I am trying to keep this post to a minimum but at the end of the day I feel he only loves one very specific side of me. And I just can’t be that person all of the time. In theory I could get back on medication and try therapy but I know from experience what a long, bumpy road that can be and he just doesn’t understand. He also won’t understand why I want to break up. I’m just feeling hopeless and alone right now and I don’t know how to proceed."
219,"Hopefully this isn’t too much of a long one but here we go. 

I’m a junior in college rn. I just transferred to the school I’m at now after finishing my associates degree at a different school near by. I am taking a class where our instructor put the whole class into 10 teams that have to work together for the whole semester. The main goal of the team was to make a video outlining a activity we did together and a huge paper describing the processes of team building. Our group has me (21m) and one other guy (21m), and three girls (21f, 21f, 23f). 

We decided our activity should be a pretty easy hike that would take a few hours to complete and video tape the whole thing. Once the hike was done we started to truly bond as a team and I’d say we all starting to becoming friends with each other. The last two weeks I needed to do little “interviews” with my teammates for the video. We decided to do them in the rec center that our school has. 

I showed up early to set everything up and noticed that one of the girls in our group was already there. I went up to her and started chit chatting with her. She suggested that I should show her around the rec center (I go to this red center everyday I’m on campus as I’m trying to put on muscle and get in better shape) while we wait for our recording space to free up of people. 

We start walking around the place and I’m showing her all of the cool hidden secrets about the rec center.  Once on the third floor I showed her a room where they do group workouts together and classes. She suggested that her and I should do a class together sometime. I responded with a sure, that would be fun. While walking around with her everything felt natural. Like she is extremely fit and attractive yet reserved and all around a great personality. Talking with her just felt easy. We do our interviews one on one with each team member and I honestly thought it was cute how nervous she was in front of the camera. I was able to calm her down and we got her part nailed down, along with the rest of the video. 

Since then I needed a bit of info for the video so I texted everyone in the group for that info. Her and I stuck up a conversation that eventually died off. I just finished the video and sent the link to our group chat. She was the first one to respond (fairly quickly, like enough time to watch the video) and said “that was amazing ‘theyodabossyt’!!! I love the video! Thank you so much you are awesome!!” 

I asked my buddy what he thinks of this whole situation and he thinks I should shoot my shit and try and become better friends with her. Potentially more if the future holds that in store. I was thinking of texting or asking in person if she wanted to go on another hike or do one of those classes together or simply get lunch some day. 

What do you guys think? This is the first time I’ve had any interest in someone since getting out of a long term relationship about 6 months ago. Thanks for any advice!!"
220,"Ok I'm gonna try to keep it as short as possible but it's still probably gonna be a long ass read regardless.

4 months ago my gf (21) broke up with me (23) after a few long and painful months. We met 3 years ago and started dating around the same time. Looking back at it, it was a very toxic relationship and it should have ended long before this. 2 months into dating she started showing some of her true colors. We were talking about kim kardashian and I told her that what she does is smart for her. I don't like her or what she does but I can't denie that someone who has accomplished what she has, has to be at least somewhat smart. That was the first time she exploded and I saw her self esteem/phsychological issues. The amount of insults she threw at me for not agreeing with her were insane. I honestly should have ended it back then. Unfortunately i held on the the image she shows of herself when she isn't freaking out, which was the sweetest girl you could imagine. 

Throughout those 3 years I have had to endure a lot of verbal and some physical abuse from her, which at the time, I thought nothing of it. At least not nearly as much as I should have. It ranged from:

Beeing mad because I looket at a girl in our general vesinity, the same way I looked at the guys. 
Thinking I sneezed in order to look after a blond girl behind us
Insulting my looks, mental state, intelligence and friends for diffrent opinions on girls on instagram.
Jealousy because she always thought I found her ex best friend more atractive than her.
Slaping and in one instance, running full speed and punching the back of my head as hard as she could. Her reason, 2 girls walked past us while taking a walk and of course she though I was checking them out.(I never thought of punching a girl but on that ocasion, I was very close)

And a lot of other things I honestly don't have the will to list on here. Also those things happened every other week or so. Probably even more often. But I cinda allways hoped these things would start to fade away over time. I never thought of these things as intentional on her part because she said herself that she knows she doesn't have anything to worry about from me.

Now fast forward to february this year. 
Her mom was diagnosed with late stage colon cancer the year before but after 2 months of chemo therapy it seemed to be gone. Unfurtunatly it came back and there was nothing to be done. She ended up in a special facility for people who's death is certain which i don't know the english noun for atm. In german it is called Hospiz. What you need to know is that her mom was my ex gfs best friend, life coach and just by far the most important person in her life in general. For me, she wasn't just the mom of my gf, she was a real friend and the only one who understood how hard it could be with her. So we both had a really hard time. I was trying to be there for her as much as I could but it was never enough. Her mom passed away on june 28. The day before that we talked about our relationship and if we should still be togheter after everything. Unfurtunatly, after all that had happened the last few months, I was understandably exhausted. Mentally, physically and emotionally. So I told her I don't know. 
On the day her mother died we had the same talk again and I told her to concentrate on herself. 
I'd be fine. 

The next day she goes on a date with a guy 10 years older than me and leaves me for him. 

This broke me, after all the shit she gave me for girls I didn't even look at she does this. I still think I'm in a nightmare 4 months later. I was very angry and I let a lot out on her, not nearly enough mind you but still a lot. When my temper cooled down and I knew I couldn't do anything I asked her to please take her time and maybe wait for 2 weeks before really starting to date the guy so that I could have some time to reassamble my mind. It was obvious he would wait, I talked to the guy myself once. But she just said no. But it wasn't just that, anything regarding me she didn't care for anymore. It was not like I hurt her, if anything I did everything for her during her mothers last months. I thought the very least I'd get would be some empathy and gratefullness on her part. But I'm not kidding when I tell you that there was nothing, no remorse for how bad she was hurting me, not slightest hint of empathy. I went from the second most important person of her life to someone she couldn't wait to get out the door in 2 days. 

A month later, after I had a few mental breakdowns, I was diagnosed with depression. The exam I was studying for was far out of my reach as I could study a max of 2 pages a day and my life was just going downhill nonestop. 
The friends I still have I rarely see. Most of them went to diffrent citys to study and the others are in a relationship so they obviously and understandeably don't have a lot of time. Meanwhile I started a dead end gasstation job to get some money in order to start studying psychology but I still have that last exam in front of me.

Most of my days now consist of working/studying and then going home where I talk as little as possible to my parents as I hate every moment of my life right now and I really don't want to let it out on the last ones who seem to care about me.

But to be honest, I think I'm slowly aproaching the end of my road and I'm scarred of what I might do.

Thank you to everyone who reads through this mess. You've allready shown me more respect than Luana."
221,So i was dating this girl for about 3 months. We have a great time together and the sex is great. Now she tells me she is missing the right feelings she had directly with her ex and she is not sure they will come in the future. She admits there is something between us (more than freindship) but she doesn't want to give me false hope and wants to stay friends.. What should i do? I want her as a gf not only just as a friend.
222,"My partner of 2 1/2 years (male - 30) admitted that he felt rage at me after I: 

A) didn’t listen to him and add his nectar card to my online order for the points (he was so annoyed he actually hit himself in the forehead)
B) didn’t appreciate his effort of making me and him lunch (he made more effort when we were running late and I had suggested making a sandwich) he started cooking something - this something looked quite little so I thought I’d be nice and say I didn’t want any and he threw it all in the sink. 

So how big are these flags? Are these flags? 

I’ve never felt rage at someone even an ex who cheated (highly annoyed and angry but not a rage)."
223,"**I really need help, this is driving me crazy.** 

I looked it up on Quora but I cant seem to get any answers. 

*So I am new here and I am asking for your help :/*

*Thanks*"
224,"As the title suggests really - I’m in a fairly new relationship (15 months) and the sex is wonderful and sometimes I laugh with the sheer joy of it. My partner this weekend has told me that it puts him off. I’m not laughing at him or poking fun it’s just joy that I’m experiencing. Obviously I didn’t know that it was off putting for him and affecting his performance (didn’t think there was an issue). 

He is the first partner I’ve ever felt this with or done this with and he says he’s never had anyone behave this way either.  I’m now cautious about making love and I’m monitoring my reaction."
225,"This might be long as I feel the background info is necessary and I apologise for any mistakes but I'm new to Reddit after googling advice! I (23F) haven't had the easiest life, I've never particularly felt love and I was abused emotionally, sexually and physically into adulthood and it took a lot of strength to cut ties with my family and my boyfriend. 

After 6 + months I reevaluated my life and what I wanted and concluded while I wanted a relationship I fear not having control and feeling trapped. However I am highly sexual and in the BDSM community, and found myself starting a relationship with K (44M) who is married to C (F48) and knows of my existence. K and I have had similar traumas that we both feel influenced our interest in kink and ultimately fell in love with each other due to the bond and trust that our BDSM relationship brought us. We have a lot in common and if we had met at a different time/circumstance probably would work as a 'normal' relationship. C is completely non sexual besides once or twice a year, and feels happier knowing there's no pressure, they are more 'companinons' whose only family is each other and K's sex drive matches my own. K has shared how deep our feelings are and C has been supportive and acknowledges I bring K happiness and fulfill a need she cannot (C isn't open and sees no one else). I have not met C due to her feeling somewhat insecure. 

While all of this has been happening, I have been extremely unwell with ovarian illness and ultimately decided a full hysterectomy come January would be the best treatment. I have been told continually over the course of this extremely difficult period that I cannot produde a biological child anyway,  I previously never felt inclined to have children (due to my own traumatic childhood) but the decision was still very difficult and took counselling to decide to go ahead. Me and K discussed contraception early on, and given we are both clean and I cannot conceive we felt safe without. Similarly K's wife does not want children, and pregnancy with another partner is a hard line for her. 

In conversation about life and abortion (my friend was going through one) K expressed if accidental pregnancy happened with someone he loved he would ultimately leave his wife for that family IF the mother kept it, and say nothing if she didn't. I said I found this concerning and that he should probably have a hard think about what he wants as it seemed a little complex and strange to me (however I have no prior experience of polyamory). 

This week I was back in hospital and a routine check  revealed I was (despite the 'impossibility') pregnant. I wasn't to see K for 3 days, and it felt widely inappropriate to tell him while he was with C. We have just had a wonderful 2/3 days together before I finally got upset and told him I'm pregnant. We stayed up all night, tears were shed, we talked about our fears and what would happen either way. 

Emotionally this is difficult. This is likely both of our only chances to ever have a child. We made the impossible happen for my body. We love each other so much and are happy, but we don't know what we would be like together in a full time relationship. If we decide to keep the child, K will leave C and she will have essentially nothing. No family, no husband, and no home because despite a successful career she financially relies heavily on him spending her own  income on fashion and beauty.  She will be heartbroken and angry. If we decide to abort, he likely won't ever tell her and they'll remain married.

This is so confusing. I love him but I love him with the awareness that I'm the second woman. We're both incredibly emotional because we never thought we could or would have a child. Neither of us have a family, we'd be all the child had. I have to factor in my treatment while pregnant. If we go forward and we tell her and I later miscarry or my health declines again, was it a waste? Would he resent me? If I have an abortion and he never tells her and I remain the secondary partner will I feel resentment? Should I even take into consideration a strangers feelings/ life while deciding on the life of my potential child? Do I ruin someone's marriage? I'm hurting and confused. 

This is all so complicated and difficult so any words of encouragement/support or advise would be appreciated xx"
226,"My husband has a porn addiction but we’re working through it. He’s currently on day 65 no porn, woohoo. I have to check his computer which he has no problem with because he wants me to keep him on track. 

I looked at his computer today and pornhub was open. I was obviously disappointed and upset and I asked him why he was watching it. He said it wasn’t real porn and he was just watching a dumb video of some guy peeing into his mouth. (Found on Reddit) I know pornhub has these graphic intro ads so I asked him and he said he didn’t look at it and he didn’t look at anything else and he just wanted to see a funny video of a guy pissing in his own mouth. Gross but it’s fine if those are his interests. I was still upset because I know the ads are long and the stuff on the sides, I really hope he didn’t look at it. He’s saying he didn’t but still I think even opening porn hub is not helpful to his progress. I’m worried he may have been triggered or something. He thinks he’s fine. He knows I’m writing this and he’s curious to see the responses too. 

So who’s right? Any advice for this situation?"
227,"I got divorced about 2 years ago following my wife's affair that I discovered. We had 2 young kids and she emotionally manipulated me at the time to try and convince me I was going mad. I eventually confirmed I wasn't going mad and she had been having an affair for around 8 months. I met my current partner about a year ago. She was cheated on by her husband and had a 1 year old kid at the time.

The result for me is a crippling anxiety when my girlfriend says she's going out with her friends. I never used to get this I don't know if I'm scared of her cheating or I feel abandoned by her for her friends but I feel so wound up inside. Let's say she says she's going out with friends in 3 weeks, I feel physically drained for the entire time and it gets worse as the time approaches. When she goes out I feel utter dread and then feel distant to her for days after. I don't know how I can stop this. I know it's irrational and I know that if I don't stop she will resent me. I don't try and stop her but she must sense my issues. The strange thing is it's only when she goes out with friends drinking or in that environment.  My wife's affair was at work so its illogical. I have spoken about this with a therapist but this didn't help me. 

Has anyone any advice on how I tackle this? I love her and I know i will drive her away eventually. I also don't want to feel like this either in myself. I have my own friends and go out with them occasionally although not as much as I'd like.  I feel like this is crippling me and need to do something about it. Can anyone give me sound advice or similar experience.

Tdlr: anxiety whenever girlfriend goes to bars or drinking without me."
228,"So, right now my bf isn’t around, he’s in college elsewhere, but all of this happened around before he left. I’ve only been extremely close with her for about a year at this point, so if she had a thing for him beforehand, I wouldn’t have had talked to her enough to notice. But as soon as I began talking to her more often, she started doing and saying things which caught my attention. I’ll list them in chronological order.

1. Firstly, I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while. We’ve talked about marriage and stuff a lot, and somehow it came up in conversation with my friend. I was saying something along the lines of, “I can’t wait to marry him,” and she replied with “Well you know, that’s a while away. Anything could happen.” This was EXTREMELY out of character for her because overall, shes a generally enthusiastic and positive person. This had been the first time she’d said something negative about my hopes or plans.

2. Secondly, I began to noticed she focused on him a lot at parties I’d have with my small friend group. She’d try to embarrass and annoy him the most out of everyone.

3. Thirdly, she always asked him for rides to parties which I was fine with, but on numerous occasions she’d argue with me that she deserved to sit in the front meanwhile I sit in the backseat sometimes and it was unfair that I always sat in the front when my boyfriend was driving. One time we were going to the store, and she went as far as just making it out the door before I did, and hopping in the frontseat of my boyfriends car before I could even say anything.

4. During the summer, she highly encouraged him, and only him, to jump into the pool. At parties, she’d say she wanted to swim and was fine with me just dipping me feet in, but pushed my boyfriend repeatedly over and over to go swimming. She suggested ways for him to swim too such as letting him wear a pair of her shorts and encouraging him to go home to pick up his trunks.

5. I thought things had died down since he left, but I was wrong. Recently, my boyfriend alluded to the fact that he may propose to me soon and I told her about this because I was excited but also very nervous. She started telling me he should wait, being very inherently negative about it, saying we’re so young and all that jazz, which if you remember, extremely out of character. It especially got to me when she said, “It’s great that he loves you this much,” and I said, “yea I gotta feel lucky,” and she said “yea, you should.”

Aside from all this, she’s a great person and has been such a great friend. She encourages me through my tough times and is always so supportive of every decision I make. She gives me rides and helps me out with things too, she’s just a great friend, so I have no idea what to do. I wouldn’t mind if she liked him, but the fact that she’s liking him and making moves? I don’t know. Maybe I’m just overthinking this and she doesn’t even actually like him.

tldr: My friend keeps doing things which alludes to the fact that she likes my boyfriend, but she’s a really good friend so I don’t know what to do about it"
229,"So here the situation. We broke up about a year ago (February to be specific) the relationship was just over two years. 

The relationship was caring and loving were we'd listen to each other and help each other with problems that we had. Sometimes video calls that we had would just be silence and I'm not super comfortable with just plain silence. But never the less was good at the start. 

Something to note is that we met in my last year of uni where we studied in the UK. And at the end of it I had to move back to Germany as that's where I'm originally from and don't have family in England. So most of the relationship was long term which is pretty hard. 

I came back to do my masters and we'd meet up regularly. Started off with each other trading who goes to who's bit then start just being me going to hers . Was around then that She started growing distant. (Few months before the end). 

The breakup happened the week of her birthday where we were going to go to Wales for a holiday but didn't happen because of a crash we were both in (Boone got hurt just a little soreness). The following day she broke up with me and I had to stay at hers cuz I couldn't afford a train ticket home (so had to wait) .

Anyways ever since I thought I was ok saying that I didn't need her to be happy as I have things going on in my life. So I cut contact trying to get away. But I keep getting drawn in to talking to her again. (Longest I went with out talking was 3 months) I try to just focus on what I'm doing and try to push my feelings for her out. But I seem to just keep spiralling into a depressive state. 

It seems to just be getting worse and worse where I have a hard time just getting up to do things that I used to love.

 So my question, is there something I can do to get over this as I the feeling getting worse with no end. 

Thank you for reading and for your advice."
230,What do you guys think about going threw your mans phone??? I’m tempted to do it but I don’t want to break that trust. What are your guys thoughts???
231,"I'm currently in undergrad and met this young lady in one of my classes. We hit it off pretty well and started studying together, then eventually started hanging out without studying, and now it could be said we're ""seeing"" each other. This has been going on for about six weeks. 

I've grown to like her quite a lot in the short time we've known each other. She selflessly took me to the hospital after I sustained a head injury in the first couple of weeks we were seeing one another, forfeiting her attendance in 2-3 classes as well as an in-class quiz.  She has also stated that she likes me a lot too and enjoys the time and attention I give her. I can offer more backstory and details if indicated. 

Now for my dilemma: she stated before we started officially seeing each other that she ended a long term relationship around six months prior to us meeting (lasted around four years). As such, she has been hesitant to say that we are ""together"" or ""exclusive."" I posed the question to her a couple of days ago, phrased as ""what exactly would you consider us to be?  She said she wasn't really sure how to answer that and I've tried not to push the issue, but it's actually making me somewhat anxious. 

I want to be respectful of her state of mind, but at the same time I'm wanting to look out for my own. I really want to be in a relationship with her, but I don't want to pressure her by keeping on asking the question. How should I approach this?"
232,"Got a bf for 8 months now. We got together after his breakup from a long-term relationship. Befor our relationship we were best friends and had spend every day together. He got depression and talked about everything with me. He never has talked with anyone this open than me. I knew everything about him. Because of his depression he went into a ""hospital"" for several months. He was about 300 miles away from me, but we made it. He called me every day and he was always laughing and smiling. I loved it. 

When he got back he had to take medication. Everything was fine. We went outside often and could talk about everything. Time went by and for some reason he got silent. He refused to talk about his problems and started to hide behind his video games. He also stopped taking his medication. I tried to talk about it a lot, because I got worried. For a few reasons we moved into a apartment together. The first month was great, because he was taking his medication again and he began to talk with me again. He wanted to spent time with me a lot and I thought everything was okay again. Well, the last weeks he started to get frustrated. (We also havn't had sex in months, which is quiet strange, at least for us). He stopped talking with his family and only is sitting on his PC. Sometime he wont speak a complete day to me. He is eating non-stop, does not take his medication and if I want to confront him, that I am not feeling well, he only says: Then break up. 

He is always cold and ignoring me, if I want to confront him. Lately he kinda kicked me out, cause he thought I would leave him (never said it). Sometimes he is yelling at me and sometimes he gets even aggressive and hits a desk or other stuff. He refuse to get a job and yeah ...

I don't know what to do anymore. On the one hand he is telling me, he don't want to lose me and want me as his gf. On the other hand he is not even able to tell me that he loves me. I feel like shit. I don't feel loved. I can understand that he got depression and it's hard for him to even stand up in the morning, but ... I want to be loved tho ... 

Should I break up with him? :/"

234,"I was friends with a girl in kindergarten and first grade, we’ll call her June, and we were pretty attached at the hip. After first grade, June’s parents bought an alpaca farm on the other side of the country and I was so sad to lose such a good friend, though I don’t think I truly understood how far away she was going at that point. For the first couple months after she moved we kept in contact through our moms, sending emails back and forth, me keeping her updated on what was going on at school and her sending me pictures of the farm. After a few months I stopped getting responses, and the relationship fizzled out. 

I still thought about June every now and then and about how much fun we used to have together as little kids. I wondered how she was doing as we grew older. Periodically throughout my teens I would try to find her on social media, but to no avail. Then, last night, I searched her on Facebook (I came across another old friend who also moved away and was reminded). It had probably been 5 years since I last searched her online, and she came up! I added her and by this morning she accepted my friend request. 

For a bit more context, I recently moved to the other side of the country and am about an hour away from where June moved back in first grade. I think this is maybe why she finally came up in a Facebook search, as our geographical locations are closer. Given our close proximity, I would love to reach out and try to get together sometime and see if we still click the way we did so long ago. Since I moved to my new city I haven’t made any new friends as I work FT and am a FT online student which doesn’t leave much time for me, so it’s been difficult to meet new people. I also have a good amount of social anxiety which doesn’t make it any easier. 

I live with my boyfriend and his brother and all of my coworkers are male (I work at a very small web-dev firm) so I am incredibly antsy for some female companionship, and starting with a familiar face is far less threatening to me than putting myself out there to total strangers. So, my question is, how do I go about reaching out to June? Or should I? 

TL;DR: Best friend in kindergarten/first grade moved across the country and we lost contact. Recently found her on Facebook and we live rather close to each other now. Should I contact her and try to rekindle our friendship?"
235,"Longgggg story cut a little short... I’ve had a rough time with relationships in the past, mainly the guys fault... but some mine (I’ve been physically abused &amp; cheated on by my ex’s)

Fast forward to now... I have this great guy... well due to things that have happened in my past one night I had a dream he was cheating on me &amp; started crying... twice🤦🏻‍♀️ so he allegedly made a “deal” with this girl that they would sext to see if I looked through his phone... okay now this is where things get sticky... the last time I cried was in July, it’s October... they made this “Deal” 4 months ago. Sunday I was cleaning the boat &amp; he got a Snapchat... if you know me personally my personality is to make everything funny... well he was mowing the lawn so I grabbed his phone assuming it was one of his guy friends &amp; was gonna snap them back and be like “Sorry I’ve got my slave outside working” 

PLOT TWISTTTT, it wasn’t one of his boys... &amp; now I’m broken... after reading those messages I don’t know what to believe... he says it was the deal they made and “nothing was real” then why is she so upset that he isn’t sexting with her anymore?☹️

This has been a long week... and I’m just as confused if not more confused then I was when I found the messages😣💔 I’m broken... I don’t know how to feel or what to say...🥺"
236,"This is my first time making one of these so..

It’s such a long long history with us since I was 13-14, being long distance and all, him in Louisiana , me in Maryland. Of course we were all giddy and everything was so goofy at the start, starting off as just a crush. We break up/just grow apart a few times but still talked. At first he didn’t know what I was to him until I was gone (we were younger so understandable), so ever since, even if we blocked each other or didn’t speak, we would always gravitate right back to each other. Whether we had a boyfriend/girlfriend or not. 

We’ve always been close obviously and always talked about a future together, and he’s been haunting me through all my relationships after him (haunting in a good and bad way, just always in my mind). Even with the condition I have (MRKH), he’s always stuck to everything he said he was gonna do/wanted to. He always told me he just wanted ME. So fast forward, we would always tell each other who we were messing with and he even told whatever girl it was about me and I was still a priority somewhat. 

He enters the navy and I’m always the one he called during boot camp or whatever it’s called (they have to wait in line to do phone calls). Then after that, when he finished he had disappeared before being able to tell me he was going on the ship so I took that as a lost and he suddenly disappeared on me, not thinking he was on the ship yet. I moved on, painfully, and got a boyfriend after a couple months. After two or three months of this bf and I being together I had suddenly got a message from (we’ll call him Demetrius, my long distance). He had sent me, I believe, two long paragraphs explaining what had happened, how he felt about me/how he felt when he saw me with someone else. He sent this to one of my other Instagram accounts because I had him blocked on my main. At that time I had went off, especially because my then boyfriend was right next to me. He asked to be friends and I had initially said no. Months down the line I start to talk to him again because I missed my best friend and I didn’t want it to be like that between us. 

^^^^^all of that is for context^^^^^^

Fast forward again and I’m single, still talking to my ex and we’re on DECENT terms. Demetrius is gonna be 3 hours from me soon and I’m scared I’m not gonna be how he imagined me or he’s not gonna be how I imagined him. There’s only so much you can TRULY know about a person over FaceTimes and expressing emotions. For extra context, he has helped me pay my bills, sent me more money than I’ve even asked for, been there to hear me rant, etc etc. He’s just always been there and has damn near promised me we would be together. I thought it’d fade with age because we started so young, but it never did.

TLDR: gonna meet long distance love soon, scared it won’t be how I imagined/I won’t be who he imagined. Anyone have experience with this? Any tips/things to reassure me??"
237,"Hi,

Couple of months ago my GF told me(M30) that she had some financial issues. She told me that she now was scared to open letters and answering calls. I helped her pay some of the bills that gone to debt collection.

However she still wont open letters, and seems be withholding information about finances. Every time i talk to her about it she starts to cry. I feel like whatever i try to do does not help. I don't really wanna lend her more money cause tbh I don't think i'll ever get it back.

I know that her parents would help her if she asked them.  Would it be terrible of me to ""snitch"" on her?

&amp;#x200B;

I do apologize for the syntax and spelling mistake. I'm Danish."
238,"Basic back story: 
We have two kids and a house together.

I have trust issues regarding such a situation and have made it well known.

We have security cameras set up and when I left the house he’d always be like “where you going?” Until one day I blew up on him over it. He was never okay with a vague answer and wanted time frames that some times I just didn’t have one, or even times I didn’t really know where I was going but I just needed out of the house.

I have never lied about where I have been to him. 

Occasionally I enjoy going to the casino (when and if I can afford it). Maybe take $200. I set limits and stay within them. I don’t have a problem but he knows when I broke up with my ex I lost a bunch of money there (I had plenty of money to spare and didn’t go beyond my means of living, nor did I ever spend money that was necessary for bills).

We had a big fight over this because he doesn’t like that I go at all because he finds it to be a waste of money. (I rarely spend money on myself - this is my occasional guilty pleasure. I have clothes from 5+ years ago while he eats fast food daily.)

I told him that I was going to stop telling him every time I went because it just caused more fights. However, any time he has specifically asked if I’ve gone I have admitted when I have, how much I took and how much I left with.

I’m sure he will justify this as his reasoning. However I find it a huge breach of trust to be monitoring my whereabouts in such a way and especially without my knowledge or permission. I’m just not sure how to bring it up/address it to him... or even further on that, I’m not sure to which extent I should feel like my privacy has been violated/how upset I should be.

TLDR; My partner set up Find Friends on my phone without my knowledge when I specifically have mentioned I feel like I’m being monitored and I have a right to privacy. Would you be upset? How would you deal with it?"
239,"I thought we were supposed to be more than friends but that idea ended years ago. Now we’re just formal ghosts. I just want to be happy. Just happy. You used to be a goal of mine but now you’re an obstacle. I was happy for a few months until you came back. And then for a moment I had a choice, to chase you again or finally move on. But it wasn’t a choice was it, it was a waiting point. You picked someone else, as always. Afterwards, I only spoke still to you out of hope and guilt. All that’s left now is guilt. Now...even that is running out. You made your choice. I Just want to be happy and you’re in the way of that. Please block me again so I can find the strength."
240,"So I was dating this guy for about two years, we broke up twice but have always managed to find our way back to one another. We live together and though we're not officially dating, we still do everything together such as family dinners , watching movies, playing games, going out to eat, dining in, etc. Before we started hanging out again (prior to moving in) I recovered my old dating profiles to see what was out there and try and move on. 
Every one in a while I go on just to check it out, one day I found his profile on one of the dating sites, I confronted him about it because he is not the type to talk to girls or to socialize much at all really.  When I confronted him he didn't really give me a good answer other than ""I don't talk to any girls"".

Last week we were hanging out and I asked again about his profile , he said he would not/does not  talk to girls and would never sleep with any or hangout. He said he just wanted an ""ego boost"" because he likes the attention... He also said that if he did talk to girls , it wouldn't go far, he'd be doing it to step his game up to impress me.....

That was very confusing. I did not believe that, and I definitely don't now 

He told me he did not have a tinder profile, but I just found it tonight and he posted a photo on it that he took today. 

So it really feels like he's lying and manipulating me. 

He says he would be upset or hurt if I spoke to guys or hungout with any, but why would he make these profiles just to get likes? 

He doesn't seem to care about anything or anyone which he's expressed to me multiple times, but he has said he cares about me and that I still live with him implying that I'd he didn't want me around, I wouldn't be living with him.

He says stuff like ""if we do end up getting married and having kids..."" 

Please help, any advice would be great 


TDLR; Guy I live with and have dated says he uses dating profiles to get an ego boost and to up his game to impress me, he made a new profile when he said he didn't have an account and would not sleep or hangout with girls, and that he's not speaking to anyone. I'm very hurt and upset, he keeps me around and makes it known that he kind of wants me there but acts different."
241,"I’m a (21M) and been with my girlfriend for about 5 months and found out in our first month she went to dinner with one of Ex’s and tried to go to six flags with him “platonically” without telling him she’s in a relationship. After that altercation when she went to her hometown Toledo , Ohio for her parents wedding around July 4th she went to another one of her old FWB house with just her , him and one of his marine friends for “food” but in this case she let him know that she is seeing someone prior before I addressed and made it known that I know about the first Ex.
Is she cheating? And how do I find out?"
242,"I’m very conflicted right now...My boyfriend at the moment does not believe that he’s not going to “chase” me or communicate at all to solve our issues. Instead, he can go as long as it takes until I come to call him and fix our issues to not speak to me. We can go for days and days with nothing and he won’t do anything. I just want an honest opinion if this is healthy in a relationship? If I should just relax and wait until he comes even if it takes weeks? I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t be the one to fix everything? Advice please!!"
243,"Yes its complicated. I met her during her visit to the city, and we just meshed so well. Everything about us was right except for the fact that she had a bf bavk home. According to her their relationship was a dead end anyway. But when she returned home she was set to go on a 2 week long trip with him and a few friends. She said she would find the right time to tell him. And she did. But he begged her to stay. And she did, fucked him even. She didn't tell me until i asked on the last week of her vacation. So i left.

She begged me to stay and said she would leave him before the end of the month. She was at her first week of uni and needed time to focus. So i agreed. It was a very rough time. Everytime she flirted with me i would remind her of her bf. Next thing i know she's decided she cant stand hurting me like this and blocked me on everything. Which hurt, immensely.

Fast forward to the end of the month and she's sent me a beautiful playlist and mailed me a 4-page love letter begging me to give her a chance. She left her bf immediately after blocking me and, after annoying her friends with stories of me, she decided she did not want me to be the one that got away.

I am head over heals with this girl and I firmly believe these mistakes are an exception not the rule.  

How do I restart this relationship with her?"
244,"Bf (21) me(20) in an almost 1 year relationship, always fights for the past few months. Small things turns into huge misunderstandings. Most of it ends up between the lines of ""im tired"", ""lets stop this"". He gives me his all, no shit he says im his number one, top priority. However i cant seem to make him my number 1 in return. I put importance to my future (studies, friends) but i always put time and effort in us but he tells me why cant i give him my all like he does for me. Truthfully i didnt ask for his 100 percent. Im happy he loves me but sometimes it makes me feel like what i can give 'us' will never be enough for me to reciprocate his love that he gives me.

I love him but it feels like my love isnt enough for him. Should i still work things out when i dont deserve him and cant give him the love he needs or just let us be and give things up?

Truthfully i want to work things out but i dont want him to feel unimportant anymore. I feel like if i continue to try, and made things work, there will still come to a point where i will make him feel unloved.


sorry for bad english not my first language"
245,"Basically past few months I've been focusing on myself for a while working out etc and I'm feeling really good I'm extreamly happy with my self and where I'm going in life. 

Basically to keep it short (ish) I was seeing this girl not so long back for about 4 months she broke it off saying she needed time to focus on herself I said okay and started focusing on myself. 

Recently she messeged me saying she's in a better place now and wants to see if what we had was worth working on her words 'what we had was amazing' 

Here is the problem I do like the girl but I'm in such a good place right now I just can't seem to want to be with her like I enjoy her Company she's really nice and really hot... 

Im just confused if there's someone I like why I'm having 2nd thoughts if I should carry this on seeing each other for about 3 weeks now. 

I just feel like I can't be any happier and I feel like getting into a relationship can really only ruin my mood on the long run if we split or something 

Any advice would be appreciated just super confused right now. Thanks 

Tl;Dr seeing a girl who I really like but feel so happy with myself and don't k ow if to continue or just say I'm not interested when I am."
246,"What’s up guys! I’ve always seen some really interesting and amazing posts on here, as well as interactions between people, so I thought I’d bring my story here. 
I’ve always had trouble talking to women. whether it be over text, in person, or over the phone, I always kind of freeze up and only think of “dry” responses like “how’re you today” or your basic small talk. I’ve always thought that maybe I just overthink it to much and that’s why I freeze up, but at the same time I just feel like I lack creativity or that flare that some people have. People have said “just be a dick” but that doesn’t work for me, I’ve tried it but it comes off too dickish because I’m forcing it also helps I’m a genuine dude who has manners and respects others. I’m just looking for advice on how I can get rid of this dryness I bring to the conversation!"
247,So me and my gf (both 19) have been together for 3 months. We both work at job where we are on call. I was supposed to go up and see her tonight and say for 5 days. I called her and asked her if I can take it she said yes but you have to stay home now (we live an hour away but  my work is about 10 min closer to her than me) so I said I plan on coming anyways and long story short she’s ignoring me ans is pissed? What can I do to fix this.
248,"So my ex and I dated for 2 years and we broke up last year around this time, but we’ve stayed friends and have kept a friends with benefits thing going on. It’s been hard for us to decide what’s going on between us and yesterday we sorta came to a conclusion.

So we said that it’s probably not good for us to keep at this but we both didn’t wanna stop either. So we said f*ck it and agreed that whatever happens, happens because we didn’t want to feel bad for doing this anymore. We agreed that if one or the other person starts to have something (sex or relationship) with someone else then we’d tell each other and we’d end whatever we’re doing. 

I said I wouldn’t mind getting back together since what we’re doing is basically a relationship without the labels and relationship amenities, but he said he didn’t know. I asked him if he was undecided because maybe he just didn’t want a relationship with me and he kinda harshly said back “maybe I just don’t want a relationship”. I let it end at that but I don’t really know how to feel. 

I don’t know if I’m just being sour and I should let whatever happens happen, if we get back together if we don’t. I’m not sure what I want. I don’t wanna lose him but I don’t know if I’m just making myself look stupid? It’s not a bad relationship like we’re not abusive towards each other but are we in a toxic relationship?"
249,"Ok so, before my current girlfriend, I was a virgin. I'm still getting somewhat used to sex and what she likes (I'm a slow learner), but I've been trying. She's pretty experienced in this arena (not at all a character flaw, just the reality) and the last thing I want is to leave her unsatisfied. And she has, well, orgasmed several times after being with me and she's always reassuring that she's enjoying the sex. She's also been very patient with me. Last night, during pillow talk, she informed me that her ex was actually able to make her orgasm nearly every time. But she also admitted that sex with him was much more about physicality than emotion, and that she essentially didn't/doesn't mind that I don't always get her there (not for lack of persistence or trying, mind you) because at least with me, she knows she's making a real connection. The ex boyfriend was also a jerk. 

On one hand, I'm confident and I buy that. Yes, I'm not nearly as experienced as the ex-boyfriend, and probably not as ""talented"", but I do treat my girl exceedingly well and our sexual encounters are always a blast. She even takes to initiating some of them. And I have heard/read that loving, intimate sex is on another level than just another hook-up or an experienced devoted fully to the physical. She's told me herself that sex with me is ""on another plane"". 

On the other hand, there's definitely some fear/worry. Not even that she'd cheat on me as much as the thought of her being unsatisfied. I want to keep her happy, and I feel like if I can't do that, I'm failing. I've found some exercises that can increase sexual stamina and I'm starting to consult tips online, and that's made me feel a bit more confident. But some advice in this matter would definitely be much appreciated. Should I be worried?"
250,"Hello everyone,

I know that the title isn't quite informative, but mostly because of how complicated this situation is to describe.

There are a few characters in this story. Mostly my fwb(?), me, guy1 and guy2, as well as her husband. She and I basically met just for Sex in the beginning, with her being in an open relationship with her husband. At first we kept it very much focussed on sex and only later on became real friends. But after that we basically stayed friends even in times when they chose to close the relationship or when she was limited to just a single affair that wasn't me. This never distraught me, even though I obviously would have liked to sleep with her and was slightly jealous of the one guy (other than her husband) that could do this. But that was an easily curbed feeling since I usually also have someone else I see.

Guy1 and her became really damn close at one point and also was an allowed affair during a time in which I and her weren't sleeping together just being friends. basically that super close friendship between them broke one day to various reasons (arguably I found someting about that guy fishy and her whole social circle basically disliked that dude, while I just believed her opinion that he was great regardless of feeling fishy. Doesn't really matter on this post though)  


Basically some time after their friendship ended and fwb/husband oppened their relatonship again we started sleeping together again. Until she drunkenly had a threesome with Guy2 and some random girl, which husband disliked and they decided to close it again. Now she kept contact with Guy2. According to her he isn't particulary reliable and often does stuff like simply forgetting meetings with her and so on.  


Basically fwb and husband opened up again. We also slept a little bit with each other again. but than she grew sexually (including playful toying around) distant and I now found out why. She told me the following:

""She basically likes me so damn much as a friend and doesn't want to risk the same happening as with Guy1.""

Don't get me wrong. If some other woman told me that I would think she simply isn't sexually interested and this is just a cop out. But this is a woman I already slept with, when asked in a drinking game to say something positive about every person in the group said about me ""He is fucking great in bed"" and tried to have a drunken threesome with me and an ex-fwb now friend of me (which ex-fwb didn't want and so we actually didn't upset her husband,since i did not know about that limitation, who is actually quite a likeable guy). Additionaly she is in general a very honest person. Perhaps even slightly more with me.  


Which means, that I actually believe her that the only reason she doesn't want to is because she is worried for our friendship. Now there are two emotions that she might think that I could develope that might be harmful to our friendship. Love or Jealousy.

Love: No chance. She is nice and I value her as a friend (and a fuck :P) but if I would know if I were in love. In fact I'm currently having another fwb (they know of each other and will also probably meet on my birthday anyway\^\^) , which I would probably want as my girlfriend if I weren't such a greedy fuck that wants to experience more women (and things like threesomes) before entering a relationship. Which arguably is better than ending a relaonship for it later on.

Jealousy: I sure am slightly Jealous sometimes. I would have loved to be that threesome, even though I wouldn'tdo it anymore now that I know her husband would dislke it and it would damage their relationship. I am also jealous if other guys get to see her a lot more. But usually there is a very good reason for it. During the time both Guy1 and me were sleeping with her, their relationship was a lot closer. Other times the good reason simply was physical vicinity, since we don't live in the same city. It's always nothing that made me dislike her and such a small feeling that it was easy to ignore.  


But this state created by her worries actually creates far higher jealousy. I don't intend to end our friendship (as complicated as she can seemingly be, towards me she is a very reliable and easy-going person. If it was for different reasons I also never felt negative towards her if we were not fucking. But now my line of though is the following paragraph:  


""Because of something that someone else (Guy1) did, we don't sleep with each other anymore. Feels like punishment for someones else mistake. Oh, but she will keep sleeping with unreliable Guy2 (and perhaps others), but not with me because I'm too loved of a friend. Which feels like being punished for doing something right.""  


I don't think she has any bad intentions and her concerns are her true feelings. But it still is kinda hurtful and perhaps the exact way to actually make me feel negative emotions towards her. And it feels like a big waste, because if she actually wants to fuck and I want it too and the only reason we don't is because Guy1 created those worries in her, this is a loss for us both in my book.  


Basically, I want to know whether you people think, if it would be worthwhile to explain my concern regarding her decision and how I feel about this situation to her. Or whether you think that would actually just be troubleful for our friendship?

edit: and sorry for my english. I'm not a native speaker."
251,"We’ve known each other for a  very long time, and she confesssed to me that she’s liked me for a long time, but doeasnt want a relationship with me. I realize I like her too, but the fact she doesn’t want to date me confuses me. We’ve known each other for a long ass time and I think we would make a great couple. Does anybody know what I can do about this?"
252,"I'm just a typical 19 year old. Uni, part time job, etc. and my girlfriend is just finishing up her final year in school.

I have been with her for 3 years. We have had a great relationship for the most part. A few ups and downs through the years as per any normal relationship but we are definitely doing well at the moment.

I love everything about her, and I know she loves me. We go on fun dates and we spoil each other. I do little things, buy her food I know she likes etc. She does little things for me too.

However, there are times where we are hanging out. Times where we just found ourselves on our phones because I guess we're just bored/burntout. She says that I don't look happy to be there - even when we go on dates she says I look upset sometimes. We do catch ourselves and tell each other to put phones away, that usually helps.

I'm not sure how to change how I look/act to make her know I am enjoying myself? I definitely am, and it's definitely not something I am in denial about.

Any advice?"

254,"I (23) have talked to my roommate (18-19?) multiple times about taking her dog out more and today I walked in from taking my own dog out to her dog leaving poop in the living room and in the act of peeing on my bedroom floor (my door doesn't latch properly).

We've had at least 3 talks since mid August about how she needs to make sure her dog doesn't make these messes, and little has been done. My bed has been peed in twice, and there's stains all over the living room that. I've told her I'm not paying for damages to the carpet in living spaces, but even I know I don't have any legal grounds if I do get charged as we're on individual leases. 

How should I proceed, since I'm at the point I want to talk to my leasing office about getting a different apartment?

Edit: TD;LR- my fresh out of high school roommate has a dog that has continously been proven to not be potty trained and nothing has been done despite 3+ discussions. Do I try talking to the leasing office about moving or what?"

1. College 
2. The first time we were apart 
3. We move in together again part 1
4. Side note about the dog
5. We move in together again part 2
6. We kind of move out

8. Now 
9. A little extra

It was nice she was talking to one of my friends who I didn't realize was 1 of her friends too and we instantly clicked it was amazing it's still amazing. My roommate was always gone in someone else's Room so she ended up just dormbing with me basically. It was a running joke between the 3 of us that she was the 3rd roommate. But we all got along and it was grate. She helped me quit smoking got me to focus more on my studies and I ended up graduating as she failed out. 

2.As I said I was doorming in college in up state new York so I lived really really far away on long island. (Side note not everyone is rich here that is only on the Hamptons. For the rest of us it's a bedroom community.)It was about a 3 to 4 hour car ride and a 8 to 9 hour bus ride and before you ask the nearest airport was about an hour away. Yes she lived up there by the school. Now I didn't have a car at the time because my friend crashed it on me a discussion for another day. So we really didn't see each other that much for about 3 to 4 months. Until I got a can and was able to see her twice every month. Once when she came down and when I went up. She got a dog to help her and we talked on the phone every day. 

3.So eventually I convinced her to come down with me and move in with me and my father. Yes I know it's a little loserish but I don't want my dad to be alone and it would give us a chance look for to look for apartments around here. Then I started a job I hated that makes me qork crazy hours. But we where together me her and the dog. 

4.Before I go any further I love dogs are used to have a dog I want to get another dog but if you ever looked for an apartment you know the problem a dog give especially an untreated dog.

5.So the dog was getting unruly and my dad was getting sick (actually sick not just of the dog.) so the dog couldn't stay in the house. My girlfriend was able find a friend that has an animal shelter to watch over the dog until we were able find an apartment. This went on for another 3 to 4 months.

6.So we ended up looking and looking and found no appointments in our price range. My dad finally started to see someone and I was comfortable enough to move out of state so we decided to go somewhere between our 2 families.  And we did we Found a nice little gated community and our budget and the day we  Started to get the paperwork processed my dad told me he got terminally sick. So me and the girlfriend decided she would move up there start getting things together get her dog back I would still pay my half of the rent, see her as much as possible and once when I know one way or the other I would go there too. If you can guess from contacts I never did I never had the chance. 

7.After 3 months of living in the apartment she decided she can't be alone anymore so she ended up moving back in with her abusive mother (Quck take on her mother her mother has literally abused her from everything from throwing random objects are head to burning her with cigarettes to literally stealing her money when I say her mother is abusive I mean it.) and her brother. (who she cares for deeply.)  So me not really being there and understanding what's she means helped her. I rented truck we got all her stuff and she lasted about 2 weeks before she moved in with her grandmother again.

8.I'm about to see her in 2 days. This will probably be the last time I see her for a while because she wants to move 12 hours away. Somthing with my father's condition I can't see my self doing. I love her but I love my family too somthing I know she doesn't understand with her home life and the facked she moved 23 time in the spand of high school alone. I'm anchored and she's not and I think that's our biggest problem. I mean I know this more but honestly.

9.She has told me how she wants me to find a fuck buddy (which I'm not doing it never works like that.) She sobs every time I leave and she is depressed. (not in oh my life is hard, the a doctor is giving me strong medication kind of depressed.) And I I'm worried about her mental state if we brake up. Which I know shouldent even be a factor but I still care about her and love her I just can't do this anymore.

Thank you for taking the time to read this I know it's a little long but I feel like this is everything you need to know."
256,"So my friends and I booked an airbnb for a weekend and we're all bringing dates or friends. Its from Thurs – Sun and I decided to ask an old crush of mine to be my date/friend (not really sure rn, hoping to see if we get closer over the weekend). She seemed pretty into it in the texts up until I told her the dates. She said she wants to come but has class Thursday and Friday which I'm more than fine with (and I’m willing to go late to the bnb, and pick her up). The airbnb is 4hrs away from her (and me...one of us will have to drive to the other) and she’s 2hrs away from me. I’m pretty sure she thinks that she’ll have to drive to me and then we carpool to the bnb. She hasn’t replied to my text yet but I’m thinking I should drive the 2hrs to her and 4hrs down to the bnb (just to have her at the event). She has no idea that I’m covering all costs too (plan to keep it a secret as I don't mind and I just hope she has fun) and she still hasn’t responded… so did I lose this chance?

I understand and respect the fact that she has commitments but my question here is at what point does me flexing my schedule to accommodate and etc. too much? Also I should probably mention, we've only texted a little and the most recent text she sent was something along the lines of ""I want to come, but I have these commitments in the way"" and that's it (this post is simply a description of details and what I intend to text her).

I’m really not good with girls…this would be my first spending this long with a girl (although not really cause its going to be about 30 people getting shitfaced and having fun), so any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Made post easier to follow, added clarification on what's going on here"
257,Whats up guys. I (18M) had quite a thing with this girl (18F) and I slowly drifted from her and talked with her less but she really gave her all. She would ask me to go out give me hugs and would make an effort to talk to me everyday but I treated her pretty poorly and we lost contact for a bit. Well I reached out to her and we just started talking again (nowhere near as much as we used to). She tells me that she's no longer interested in me as of now but I think I've fallen for her. I really want to connect with her again by messaging her and going out and all but I don't want to be overwhelming. I feel like I owe her for everything she did for me and I'm not sure what's the right thing to do so that she doesn't feel overwhelmed.
258,"
I’m not even sure how to start this or how anyone can help/advice or what I need right now. 

I’ve (22F) been in a relationship with my girlfriend(23F) for almost 4 years. We met when we were both just starting at a new university and just clicked. As we were both inexperienced in relationships it took us a while to learn how to basically be in one together. We’ve had a couple problems because we’re both young and didn’t know how to communicate at first, but we’ve learned and our relationship has always overcome hard situations.

We’ve been living together happily for about 2 years now and decorated our home, got pets, planned trips, found new hobbies and just enjoyed life together. We’ve both been happy and communicating well. I’m not just saying it from my point of view, but from both, we discussed it and we both agree we had a really good relationship. 

The problem started since we first started dating. She would always go back to talking to this girl from back home (we’re both from an area about 3 hours away from where we live) in a way that just never felt right to me. It would always end in a fight and the solution would just be blocking her and not talking to her again. Until she’d show back up by emailing her or something usually about after 6 or more months. 

The times in between when she would show up our relationship would always go back to being the same. We both love and really appreciate each other. 

Last time she showed up was around august. I had just graduated and my gf was about to go back into school. It has been stressful getting used to a new job, her starting back school after a year off, and then little things happened in between that have been impacting our lives negatively, which I feel like has led to it impacting our relationships. Since the first time I noticed the girl was back in her life I expressed how I felt again. We’ve been both trying to improve as people so I didn’t want to keep doing the same thing making her block her after we talked and I realized how this wasn’t a healthy solution either. 

Fast forward to this month, we’ve been trying small things like having lunch together and just doing things but it has felt different. My gf doesn’t feel like she’s here. I always point out how she’s always on her phone and not present and this led to her feeling trapped because she felt like I’m always looking at her every move because all i think if if that she’s texting her. We talk it through and agree that we can just basically be less crazy. 

She starts feeling different. She acts too cautious and it’s not that I’m observing it, I just feel it, she doesn’t feel the same. I had asked her if she was okay and if we were okay, we had long talks and always came to the conclusion that we love each other so much, we can’t imagine being with other people and our relationship just feels so nice. She still feels like off. Like not just behavior wise, but like that lil light she has always had, that feeling she always radiated but that it was only noticeable when she wasn’t paying attention. It’s like when she wasn’t actively here, she was gone. 

Yesterday when I got home after work I saw her watch and checked her messages. Long story short, her and the girl are in love. All they do is talk about how they were always meant to be, they say they’re twin flames, even though they’re like water and oil, a small flame makes them snap at each other. They’re not agreeable people, and they’re both set in their personalities and it just doesn’t feel like it could be possible. But they wanna make it possible. 

When she got home she knew. We talked, screamed, cried. I kept asking questions to make sense of it. When i saw the messages I didn’t feel anything. Almost like I didn’t care because I just see it and I know in my heart it’s not real, or it can’t be, I don’t know. She told me they just recently this week realized they were in love. We had gone down to visit our families last weekend and she saw her. She kissed her. She had sex with her. I still couldn’t feel anything concrete after hearing that.

About two years ago something similar had happened to me. I kept in contact with an ex that I always felt like I was meant to be with. She felt that way too. Our relationship would be on and off and then one time when we got back in contact, we realized we really loved each other, despite all our differences and how opposite we were, there was always something with her that it just felt unique and different and I hadn’t met someone like that. We had sex and talked about being together, but after a bit I just chose my current relationship over her, because it was something I knew made me happy and I didn’t have to second guess it if this other girl wasn’t in the story. I never told my gf about this until last night, because I just didn’t want her to feel like I had such mixed feelings about is, when in reality I knew deep inside they were just part of that “what if” that I never got to experience but that I knew wouldn’t be fulfilling. 

We talked last night. I asked her if she truly loves me and she does. I truly love her too. But she really feels like this is something she needs to experience and figure out on her own and that she wants to be alone. Our lives are so intertwined. We live together. We have the same hobbies. We do the same things. We share all our socks. She’s my best friend. 

She said it’s not healthy for us to stay together right now. I told her that I don’t mind waiting. Letting her do her thing and see if she realizes that’s not what she wants. This morning we woke up and just hugged. I wanted to kiss her and act like last night wasn’t true, that we’re still in love, we’re still happy. 

I told her to stay with me. I can’t say that this is not partially because I don’t want to let her go, but because I want to try. I asked her to at least give us a month. After almost four years, I just wanted to try a but more for one month, because it’s just crazy to me that we’ve gotten through sooo many hard moments, if she truly loves me I know she’ll find it in her heart again. After talking a bit she said she could try but basically wouldn’t feel like she’s doing it for herself. And I had asked her to tell the girl that she wanted to work on our relationship for a month, I told her if she truly loves her too she’ll be there. She didn’t want to do this part, because she knew the girl would just get mad at her and probably just block her, which I get but yeah.

In my head and my heart, I feel, or like to think, not sure, like she’ll realize what’s going to happen. Like she’ll actually understand what she’s going to lose. I don’t mean this in a “I’m such an amazing person” but rather, we have built such a good relationship these past years, and we’ve both enjoyed it. I don’t like saying we’re throwing it away because honestly we’ve helped each other through so many things, I’m so grateful for her. But not trying feels like it, but I can’t force her to choose me, and I want her to be happy. 

Obviously there’s a lot of things in our story that I’m leaving out that are probably important, but I just don’t know what to think or how to feel right now."
259,"tl;dr met a fellow English speaker abroad when I moved countries. We became friends but he slowly began to change into a mean, unpleasant, and now genuinely scary person. I want to cut him out of my life, but I don't know how. (warning, a bit long)

Three years ago, I moved to a new country where English (my first language) is not the primary language. For ease of explanation, let's assume I moved to Greece.  I spoke ""Greek"" upon my arrival, but with an accent and I would make frequent errors, because I was used to the language taught in school, not the way people speak on an every-day basis. As such, for the first few months after my arrival, I was incredibly shy and had a hard time going out and meeting people. I signed up for Tinder, not to go on dates, but just as a way to talk to people in Greek in a very low-stakes way.  I ended up finding another anglophone, and was very excited to be able to talk to someone about the expat experience. We met up and had a great time chatting and getting to know each other. I'll call him Rob. I made it clear from the beginning that I had no interest in a relationship or sexual encounter with him, as I was new to the country and just wanted to make friends (it's very lonely moving to a country where your grasp of the language is mediocre and you don't have any friends or family with you…). Rob was totally fine with this, and we continued to hang out fairly regularly.

Rob is in a sort of ""neo-grunge"" band (basically they just sound like Nirvana) and introduced me to his band-mates and their girlfriends. I began to integrate into this group, and it was honestly great. We would go to bars together, hang out, get food late at night, and best of all -- we would all speak Greek together, and I could see that I was improving a lot. Our friendship went on for about 2 months without a hitch.

A few weeks after I met Rob, I ended up meeting my now-fiancé, Jack (28M at the time, 31 currently), at a concert. I had only been in the country for a little over a month at that point and wasn't feeling stable enough to start dating, but it really was love at first sight. I tried to take things slow with Jack as a result, but that didn't work out very well. After a few months we became pretty much inseparable. And it was around this point that things started to take a turn for the worse.

I would have liked to believe that with all the good things happening -- I was starting to feel properly settled into my new life, I had a friend group, an amazing boyfriend, I was making leaps and bounds in my grasp of the language -- that my life was going to be great. But the more time Jack and I spent together, the more Rob began to make little negative remarks here and there. It was never enough to cause a fight, but it did get me to put my guard up more around him. I would mention Jack less around Rob and co, because I didn't want to cause drama. Jack and Rob hadn't met, as Jack lived outside the city and worked during the week. Rob and I would usually see each other on occasional weeknights, since we lived closer, and I would spend the weekends with Jack.

Then a few months later, Rob met a girl. Things got a lot better after this -- the weird comments (that I chalked up to some kind of jealousy) stopped. We saw each other a lot less frequently, but I really didn't mind, as I was making other friends now as well, and spending more time with Jack. So we grew apart a bit, but that was fine with me.

His relationship lasted maybe 8 months or so. After they broke up, we saw each other slightly more, but still not as much as at the beginning. And at this point, things slowly started getting weird. He would make bizarre, fatalistic comments when he was drunk (saying things like he ""knew"" he was going to die soon, and when I rightfully was concerned and asked how he knew that, he wouldn't elaborate, just say that he ""knew"" ; saying that he wanted people to refer to him as ""the preacher"" because he knows the truth about things and he alone can teach people; saying he had a fatal disease, then never mentioning it again, and never seeing a doctor), and the unnecessary and rude comments about Jack started up again as well.

It came to a head one night when we were at a bar. It was getting late, and Rob mentioned that he might miss his last bus home, and he wanted to just stay in my apartment instead of getting the bus. At the beginning of the night, I made it very clear to him that I wasn't okay with him staying in my apartment, as I only had a single bed and no couch. This was something Jack and I had recently discussed and agreed upon. So I told Rob (again) that he couldn't stay with me, and that if he was going to miss his bus he had better leave soon or find somewhere else to stay because, as I mentioned before, Jack wasn't okay with him sleeping in my bed. Rob then snapped at me that **""Jack doesn't give a shit about you, he just thinks of you as some temporary whore.""**

I was so disgusted and offended that I turned around and walked straight out. I didn't say bye, I didn't finish my drink, I just left and went home. I don't know if he ended up getting his bus or if he stayed with someone else. After that, we didn't talk again for a long time.

We still had each other as friends on facebook. From that point until now, most of our interaction was limited to liking pictures, sending each other the occasional meme, and a few brief conversations. In the meantime, I had moved in with Jack (no more awful single-bed apartment!) to a new house, got engaged, and we now lived about a half hour outside the city. When I recently (as of a few months ago) got a new job working in the city, I let everyone know that I would be around more frequently than I had been, and that if anyone wanted to hang out after work, I'd be happy to. Rob wanted to take me up on that offer. I was a bit hesitant at first, but considering how long ago his outburst was, I decided that I would go through with it. I told Jack about it beforehand, and he was okay with it, but did tell me that if Rob tried any nonsense then I shouldn't see him again (obviously).

So we saw each other again for the first time yesterday. It was a bit awkward at first, because it had been so long. We got a beer, had a chat, and I was honestly thinking things were going well. And then everything just disintegrated. Someone at the bar bumped into Rob and didn't say sorry. A bit of Rob's beer spilled onto his sleeve as a result, and he just absolutely flipped. He jumped up, grabbed the guy by the arm to turn him around (he was facing the opposite direction) and started getting up in his face, asking who he thought he was that he could behave in such a way, that he should be lucky that he wasn't a more violent person or he would be talking with his fists instead, that he should consider this a warning to be more polite in the future. I was honestly terrified, I thought they were going to start fighting right in front of me, but thankfully the other guy remained calm and diffused the situation. When Rob sat back down, he started explaining to me that he did it to teach the guy a lesson, because **""the next person he bumps into like that might not be as nice as I am""**. I finished my drink quickly and told him I had to get going.

I don't intend to speak to Rob again after this, my mind is made up on that. But my question is how should I go about removing him from my life? Unfortunately he knows exactly where I work, because he met me outside the building. Do I explicitly tell him I don't want to see him again? Do I ghost him? I fear that any action I take may lead to some kind of retaliation, and I need advice."
260,"Excuse the format, I'm on my phone right now, I'm also fairly new to Reddit so I'm sorry if I do this incorrectly. 

There's a lot of back story here but I don't want it to be too long, so I'll try to sum it up best I can. 
My BF of 4 years; let's call him A, broke up with me for the millionth time last night. We recently just got out of the end of a huuuuge disagreement causing us to break up for months (but still talking and seeing each other ) because of our living situation. I think after this amount of time it's appropriate to live together, his parents are religious and they all have a family business together. He says that if I move in his parents will kick us both out since his dad co signed his mortgage and A wouldn't be able to make the mortgage payments without the occasional help from his parents. Anyways. We ended that fight and decided to work things out (again, for the millionth time) long story short he CLAIMED he told his parents I would be moving in with him. I took him at his word and slowly started moving my stuff into his house. 
The other day I asked if he could start helping me move the bigger things like my furniture and television. He then looked at me and said I think it would be a good idea to ""keep your apartment and keep all your stuff there just incase anything happened and we break up again."" I was heartbroken and felt unwanted but kid of understood since we had been so rocky lately. 
I let a couple months pass. Keep in mind he consistently promises me stuff then doesn't deliver at all or half delivers (like letting me half move in) and last night I decide to bring it up again. I told him I don't want my apartment anymore. I can't justify paying rent on a place Im hardly ever at and it drives me insane that all my stuff is in 2 different places so I never have what I need, I said if God forbid something happened I would always have my parents place to go to. But if he doesn't actually want me there I'm moving all my stuff back to my apartment and staying there full time, I don't have the highest paying job and can't afford to have to pay rent at a place I don't live. He says fine be doesn't give a shit.

This quickly escalated into a huge fight and I ended up storming out of his truck and he sped off while I stood outside crying. I go upstairs. He calls me and bitches about how he doesn't understand why I'm so ""extra"" and my life is amazing I shouldn't be upset because he constantly does stuff for me. (he has been letting me stay at his house a lot and he drives me to work after some family drama went down with my vehicle, he told me to just give it away and I could rely on him for rides until I get a new vehicle, which he promised he would also do for me but that's a different story)  I thank him for everything he does and he just says I'm ungrateful for everything. He says he'll come get me if I want for the night, I say up to you. He comes gets me (it's 11pm by now) and we go eat take out in silence. We get back to his house and I  start rolling a J to have a smoke, he mentions how tired he is and I said to go to bed then I'm gonna stay up a little while longer. He looks visibly uncomfortable at this suggestion and doesn't reply. I asked him (with a sideways look) if he's uncomfortable with me being awake in his house while.hes asleep or something. He looks me in the face and says "" what the hell did you just say to me ?"" I mumble.""nothing"" and go back to my roll as I don't want to fight more (it's midnight now) he then says ""Holt shit, you're fucked"". I put down the tray and go and sit in the garage and cry. I sit and think about what the best rational choice here is. I settle on gathering my stuff (which I was already going to do anyways, not like I did it as a breakup) and leave unless he apologizes to me. I go inside and start seperating all our laundry. He asks what I'm doing. I said I'm getting my stuff together like I said I would. He asks if I'm breaking up with him. I reply no but I'm leaving now. I don't tolerate that disrespect from him anymore. I was respectful to him this whole argument and that was uncalled for. He replies ""ok"" and goes and watches tv. I gather the rest of my stuff and as I'm finishing he tells me ""this is the last time you're packing your shit"" I ignore him. I shove my stuff in an empty closet cause there's a lot. Grab my purse and a couple essentials and order an Uber. I go stand outside in the cold and wait for my ride. He comes outside to tell me that this is my last chance to fix things. He would forgive me for everything if I cancel my ride and just come inside. I tell him all I need is an apology. He then proceeds to try to justify it cause I was saying ""stupid shit"" and he thought he saw me roll my eyes at him. 
I say I don't care I don't tolerate that anymore. He turns around and goes inside and comes back out 2 minutes later. I start getting angry and tell him to leave me alone if he isn't going to fix things. I tell him ""you're the fucked one if you think I'm going to crawl into bed with you after that"" well he didn't like that AT ALL. My ride pulls up and he screams from me at the house ""if you get in WE'RE DONE"" I reply have fun with your hoes, A ( immature I know, but I was referring to a specific incident when we were trying to fix things and I found him messaging other girls on his phone) and he replies with"" I will, your stuff will be on the doorstep including your stupid fish"" (btw we live in Canada so the weather is pretty cold right now and my fish would not survive 15 minutes outside) and my driver takes me home. I haven't heard from him since. 

TL;DR : my bf of 4 years swore at me and a pretty big fight and refuse to apologize, so I went home and he broke up with me."
261,"Both 32. My fiance has been friends with a woman for 15 years. She's always been very kind and a real sweetheart. A rare thing in our lives. Not an once of malice coming from her. Let's call her Margot.

My fiance, let's call him Alex has no friends but her and she became my friend as well through the years. She's like a sister I never had. Alex is an introvert. Social anxiety. Hates going out. She's a lot like him and they bounce off of each other.

So Alex is immature when it comes to conflict. He likes to bitch and moan rather than solving whatever issues he's dealing with. Which caused drama between him and his online gaming friends. 

But Margot, being the sweetheart that she, faces things head on. Which I agree with and support wholeheartedly. However, if there's ripples from her actions, Alex is going to blame the ripples on Margot.

Last week, Alex was gaming with our her. His brother is newly engaged to a woman. Let's call her Annie. She suck at video games but Alex endured it to make everyone happy. 

Tonight, Margot showed up at home with her laptop to game but Alex told her to go home because he didn't wanna play with his brother's fiance. Annie, the girl who suck at playing video games.

Margot asked them to chat and she explained why Alex wasn't online. She tried her best to resolve the problems but Annie got mad and called Alex. 

Alex than called Margot and he blamed her for the drama. When he should've solved the issue himself. Instead, he blamed everything on her. 

I heard everything and took Margot's side. 

You see, my fiance always put the blame on his only friend. Some days he hates her for sending funny memes. Some days she's a bad person for calling him. 

Yet, when I ask Alex if he likes her and wanna stay friends with her, he says yes because she the only person he likes. 

It's like he can't think straight and it's driving me insane. He's not rational at all and always blame the one person he's friends with."
262,"I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about 6 months now; She lives in South Africa and I live in the United States. Her parents are very old fashioned and the idea of having a random yankee showing up at their door for the first time to shake hands and take their daughter out would definitely go extremely poorly. So old fashioned in fact that if they knew she was talking to guys over the internet they would probably grill her and restrict her usage of it. I've been wracking my brain for a way to somehow figure out how to become a visible part of her life to them; pen palls? They'd ask where we met to start exchanging letters. Etc etc. So far I haven't come up with any viable ideas.

Some more details that may factor into things and explain why this is such a rough spot:

\-She's schizophrenic, but very stable and takes medication for this. But as a result of this her family treats her like she's ""slow"" quite a bit. So her just telling them outright would also go poorly and they would probably chalk it up to her condition. 

\-Obviously distance is a factor, I can't just fly there whenever I like and try to bump into them. This is keeping me from coming to visit as well so I don't just get the door slammed in my face and having traveled half-way around the world for nothing

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? I'd appreciate any help I can get."
263,"Hey guys,

my (23M) Story starts in December 2018. I was still in college but wasn't attending any classes because I was literally too depressed to get out of bed. I had no money at all and was barely able to eat every day.

A lot of shit happened before that but that's too much to talk about. 

At that point I was actually so close to giving up on everything because I felt like I had nothing to live for.

I then got to know my girlfriend (22F) who finally made me feel like my life made sense again. I lived about 1,5hours away from her so we couldn't see each other all the time. But just knowing her made me want to change my life to the better. I started looking for Jobs and eventually moved to the City she lived in just to be closer to her. I got a Job there and everything finally started to Look better.

Now that I have been with my girlfriend for almost a year, I am starting to realize that I am really dependant on her. As soon as  she's out of town I feel down all the time and barely have energy to go to work. As soon as I get home I kinda just sit there and wait for time to pass so I can finally go to bed. I've tried working out, meeting with friends but I really don't even wanna leave my house when I haven't seen her in days. 

Now she is leaving me for 2 months to go to a language school in another country and I don't know how to Deal with that. 

Part of the Problem is that she is barely ever on her Phone and therefore doesn't text me a lot. 

I just feel so fucking lonely man, I also feel like a huge fucking pussy whining about basically non existant Problems but I guess on the one Hand im more than scared she'll get to know someone Else. 

I mean I am not unattractive and certainly have other options, but I feel like she is the only one for me because she built me up when I Was so close to giving up. 

Any advice on how I can stop myself from falling back into that deep black hole called depression when she leaves?"
264,"My gf(19F) and I(20M) of two years have reached a real rough patch. We’ve had so many great moments together and enjoyed so many laughs. We were crazy in love(and still want to believe we are), talked every day about the next big plans for our future. But for the past few months lately things haven’t been the same. I try with all my heart to text her everyday all the time like we used to to keep the spark going but it’s like I’m talking to someone different. She responds with one word texts and doesn’t seem interested in continuing the conversation. We meet up maybe once a week anymore if we’re lucky and things still seem great when we’re together but almost a desensitized way from her, no intimacy between us really anymore like back the first year we were dating. I’d like to feel that I show her I really care for her, I always cheer her on in life, try to be her best friend and look after her in a non parent type of way. Then I’m just not feeling the same care back. She still continues to tell me she loves me and misses me but I don’t feel it. As of last night we started talking via the phone the usual, and I just felt like I needed to get some things off my chest to hope and save the dullish relationship and that’s when she called me over. She was already balling her eyes out when I got there and we went somewhere to talk, she claimed recently as I’ve probably noticed she hasn’t been feeling the same and her mental state has been declining as I suspected. She really loves me but a relationship just doesn’t feel right to her at all I’m her head. She goes on to say she can’t delete any picture of me though and she wants to stay really close friends and hopes I don’t hate her, which I could never do that because she was so good to me. We together changed all of our profile pictures on social media and other minuscule things. Then I leave and for the last time I text her goodnight as we agreed when I was over her house. She loses it and FaceTimes me and says we made a rushed decision and we still need to talk about this and get together all day on Friday because she just can’t imagine herself with anyone else and couldn’t imagine us just ceasing communication all together. At this point though I just needed to vent because I don’t know what to feel, the past few months were hard on me not feeling the love back I was trying to provide with open arms to her. I’m just not sure it would be right to continue together if we don’t give 100% love in our relationship. By no means is this a stab at her, she was very loyal to me and never once made me doubt her, I just don’t know if I can feel the same now after she had these thoughts of a break up with me...

TLDR: gf and I don’t seem to have the same spark as we once did, had thoughts to break up and said we were but she now can’t lose us."
265,"I just want to start by saying I am not trying to body shame at all. This is purely about my husband and I trying to avoid purchasing a new couch. 

For context, the friend and her boyfriend are maybe ~700lbs or more combined. 


Last week my friend and her boyfriend, let’s call them Aly and Mark, were visiting a mutual friends house. After Mark and Aly left, it was clear they had broken the mutual friends couch from merely sitting on it.  The mutual friend reached out to me for advice on how to handle the situation and we decided letting them know discreetly and to not ask for any compensation (the mutual friend had actually anticipated this happening and decided to handle it by lying and saying the couch was making weird sounds and might be cracked so to be extra gentle sitting on it or just use the chairs .. I didn’t think it was fair for someone to pay anything for further breaking an already broken piece of furniture).  Aly and Mark apologized and left it at that. 

So here’s where I’m having trouble: my husband and I have a Christmas party every year where Aly and Mark are always invited. We’re not super close but we have a long history together. They usually come over 1-2 times a year and are very intermingled within our larger friend group, so while they don’t come over often it would be weird to not invite them (plus I think simply not inviting them would be an awful thing to do). We also can’t exactly blame them for breaking our couch if it does happen as it’s very large and surely other people will sit on it too. 


I’m a little worried about our couch though! We believe if something is out at a party and gets broken, it’s kind of our fault for not putting it away or reigning in the behaviour that caused it to break. I wouldn’t put that frame work on other people, that’s just how we operate to avoid mishaps. 

We can’t exactly put our couch away and i can’t imagine how a conversation would go where I’m asking Aly and Mark to not sit on the couch? We could definitely chance it and hope our couch holds up better than our friends. 

**TL;DR** So what do I do? How can I avoid Aly and Mark breaking our couch without being a total ass to them? Or is it silly to think the couch would even get broken just because it recently happened to someone else?"
266,"I am 17M and my sister is 15F. About a week and a half ago my parents forced me to take 0 periods so I have to drive her to school. It has really strained my ability to sleep cause I'm waking up at like 4:30-5 in the morning and not going to bed till like 12-1. I know my sister isn't to blame for any of this and its all my parents idea but I can't help but resent this cause SHE decided to break a rule and now I'm paying the consequences for HER actions. I started dating this chick about 2 months ago and I am head over heels for her and drive her places all the time. Recently my sister has started to make fun of me and tease me all the time cause she knows I have short temper rn and can easily get annoyed at what she says.

It is midterms this week and I usually take my GF and sister to get lunch before dropped my sister off and then back to the school with my GF. So yesterday we all got lunch and when I was driving my sister back she started to tease me, I usually don't mind it at this time cause I can block her out while driving, but this time I had my GF in the car and she was bringing up embarrassing stuff from my childhood. I told her like 4 or 5 times to shut up and that this was not the right time. She told me to lighten up and I basically said ""I will lighten up right fucking now"" and I pulled over and kicked her out of the car right there. Took her a minute to realize I was kicking her out but she eventually got out and flipped me off when I drove off.

I made sure that it was only like a half mile/mile walk home or like a minute uber ride. I wasn't gonna have her walk super long or have a long uber ride, I just had to teach her a lesson that she can't just tease me and piss me off and get away with it when I'm doing HER a favor to our parents. When she got home and told our parents they. flipped. shit. I am now grounded for 3 months and on top of that I have to pick her up and drive her WHEREVER she wants to go no matter the circumstances.  I find this absolutely ridiculous and I just know she will abuse this but I don't really got anything to stand on.  

How do I tell my parents (and sister) that I’m at my wits end with no sleep and that I think punishing me a whole month by making me her slave is unfair and playing favorites?

TL;DR: my sister embarrassed me, I made her walk home, she told on me and now I’m in trouble and basically her slave for the next month or so"
267,"TL:DR: Wife slept with a married guy, kept talking to him afterwards, was also at the same time having an emotional and sexual relationship online with two foreign guys. We have 3 kids and a bad financial situation. Divorce is not an easy option and we both want to try to salvage the marriage but I don't know if I can.

  
Let me start with some backstory. We‘ve been together for almost 17 years, have 3 kids an old house we‘ve been slowly restoring over the last 2 years and our budget is not the greatest, no savings and lots of debt.

She‘s the only woman I‘ve ever been with and before me, she had only a couple of one-night stands, so we were both little experienced when we met. She‘s been the light of my life and we‘ve gone through some difficult times together and always have we been there for another. I thought we were one of the few who managed to stay on course no matter what. Apparently I was wrong.

With all that was going on, trying to fix the house, both working full time, trying to make ends meet and to make sure the kids are doing fine, we kinda lost ourselves. The bad financial situation and health related issues didn‘t help either. My wife had been trying to lose weight for a long time but nothing seemed to work for her and her self esteem was down to the floor. We were both depressed, but instead of talking and consoling one another, we suffered in silence. I buried my nose in computer games to hide from our problems while she had her nose in her phone all the time. This spring and summer, things started going worse. She was spending more time with her friends and going partying, while I stayed at home with the kids. I thought that if I let her „blow off some steam“ that she would come home in a better mood, but that didn‘t work at all.

I tried to ignore the bad feeling that was starting to sink in my stomach. I had heard a rumor that she had been seen kissing some dude at a dance in a nearby town. I confronted her about it, but she denied and said that the guy had tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away. I was not fully convinced, but didn‘t want to push her too much as I was trying to let her see that I trusted her. Yet as the summer passed, I noticed she was getting way more protective and secretive about her phone. After seing by chance what her FB password was one night in august 22nd, I decided to taka a look, to see if I could find anything about that dance earlier that summer. What I found was way worse.

I saw that indeed she had been kissing some dude drunk as hell until her friend pulled her out of it, but that‘s nothing compared to what I saw next. I accessed her Messenger and Skype.

I found out that she had been chatting online with two foreign guys, A and B, for months. It had started on Instagram, some random dude, A, sent her some flattering messages and she started talking to him on Skype after that in early June. After only speaking to him for less than two weeks she started sharing with him nude photos after only resisting a bit. The incident with the guy she kissed happened later that month. She was chatting with this guy A up until midst of August, when he showed his real intention, he was a scammer with a stolen account and was just sending her pictures from that stolen profile. Yet she had been fooled enough to share with him pictures of her most intimate parts. She seemed like she was falling in love with him. By then she was already started to talk to guy B, which also started on Instagram. Didn‘t take long for that to evolve to nude pictures and sexual talk. In both cases they were fantasizing about them coming to our country and meet with my wife at a hotel. She never spoke ill of me or anything like that, just talked about me like I was just there. If they asked, she said that I treated her well, but then she went on to tell them how she like to talk to them and they made her feel good. The worst is yet to come.

In one of the chats with a female friend of hers I found some more disturbing things. They went together to a 2 day town festival in another nearby town in early july, stayed at a rented room, which I of course had agreed to and thought would be ok, and I knew that my wife‘s friend who has trouble with panic attacks had needed to stay overnight at the local hospital. But what I didn‘t know and saw in that chat between them was that she mentioned a 41 year old guy from our own town (guy C), a married man with kids, who was unhappy in his relationship and she had met him that night. He had come over to chat and had tried to „go all the way“ but my wife told her friend that she had stopped him. She didn‘t mention the name, but I found out a likely suspect as our town is small and I also found in my online phone records that she had sent a message to a number belonging to a guy that fit the description. I feared the worst.

I didn‘t let my wife know what I had found yet, as I was afraid what would happen while the kids were around, so I put up a mask and waited until saturday 24th of august to confront my wife. I had called my mother and got her to take care of the kids. My wife is taking some classes to get some form of degree for her work and when she came home from class I asked her calmly to sit with me and I told her about what I knew. There was no violence, yelling or bad mouthing. Just two sad people, one of them angry and hurt, and we talked the whole night. She promised that nothing had happened between her and „C“ and what she had done online was only to try boosting her self esteem a bit as she thought I had stopped loving her. She didn‘t exactly try to blame me for it, nor did she yell at me for snooping around. She said she thought I didn‘t like her anymore because she wasn‘t losing weight and when those guys started raining compliments on her she said she got addicted. She said she didn‘t mean to hurt me, she was selfish and tried to please them as she could so they would keep complimenting her, therefore sending them nude pictures. She told me that she saw it now that she had been cheating on me but she hadn‘t realised it while she was doing it, even though she knew she was doing something wrong.

I wanted to believe her, I truly did. But I had concerns. We decided to try to fix our marriage and seek counseling. As the weeks passed, things seemed to be getting better. She‘s been way more affectionate to me and caring. Our sex life has been great and we‘ve been spending way more time together than before. I still had a growing feeling in my stomach that she was hiding some critical information from me and after our second meeting with the marriage counselor last week, she finally admitted the truth. She admitted what I had suspected and feared but deeply hoped hadn‘t happened. She had indeed slept with C that night in july. And even though she said she had felt bad afterwards and shameful, she still kept talking to him via social media. She admitted to have met with him twice after that, but nothing more than a bit of kissing. She even tried to contact him again a few days after I had confronted her in august.

My first response after that was simply freezing. I didn‘t yell or curse or anything. I din‘t harm her in anyway. I partly felt relieved that she had finally admitted what I suspected, but at the same time I felt humiliated and hurt beyond anything I‘ve ever felt before. I didn‘t want to rush to anything so I haven‘t thrown the ring in her face yet, nor have I confronted the other guy, as I don‘t want to be the person to rat on him to his wife or make myself get arrested for assault. Besides, it wasn‘t him that broke my marriage contract, it was my wife.

I don‘t know what to believe anymore. The woman I thought I knew would never do something like this. She‘s been trying to convince me that she was an idiot and selfish and whatnot and that she feels really bad about hurting me like that. She says she‘s ready to do anything to fix the situation and to get me to trust her again and feel like she‘s worthy again. 

Honestly I don‘t know if I‘ll ever trust her again or see her with the same eyes. I do love her of course and I like to be around her, and see her smile. But at the same time it stings my heart. I want this to work because of the kids and our shitty financial situation, as we can‘t afford going through divorce, but I fear that I will lose myself and never gain any self respect if I go through with this.

How the hell can I forgive her for cheating on me with not only one guy but three? Well, four, if you count that one time she kissed a random guy. She was both emotionally as well as physically cheating with all of them for some period of time. Not just a one drunk night mistake, but some kind of emotional and sexual relationship with three guys for over 2 months. Doesn‘t matter if two of those relationships were online. She still planned to meet with them, knowing fully what would happen if they did.

Has anyone here gone through anything similar to this and has some good advice? I know it‘s easy to say: „just divorce her man and move on“, but it‘s not that simple. I still have feelings for her and I don‘t know what will happen with our kids and our families. I also fear that if I dicorce her, which will mean that her family and friends will know the truth, that she will harm herself or at least be in a mental state where she will have bad influence on our kids. We also have an unfinished house and no savings and need at least to finish fixing it in order to get any cash out of selling it."
268,"Before you tell me to post it in r/legaladvice , I want say that we did not have sex. She told me that she was 18, I know, 18 and 25 at this ages are big difference, I know that there is a big experience gap with 18 and 25. She's great, kinda childish, but we understood each other, she can talk about adult thinks like 23 yo woman. Yesterday she told me that she's 17 and was afraid to say it, because I would stop talking to her. Now, I am not breaking up with her because of ""you can't have sex with underage girl"", but because of the fact that I know she will regret this relationship when she gains life/relationship experience. I feel like I am taking advantage of her age. She can't understand that she will grow and her thinking will change, she says that I love you and it won't change. I know why she's saying it, I was saying same things when I was 17-18, my mindset won't change and I will always have same opinions, but guess what? It changed a lot. So, I decided to give both of us some time and after some years, if we will like each other again, then we can be together, like when she will be 20-21 and I will be 28-29. Am I doing it wrong? Will 20-21 female and 28-29 male be creepy too? I'm kind of lost here."
269,"Title basically says it all. The more I read about it, the more it seems like my ex had similar tendencies, just wondering for any specific examples and ways someone can be like that so I don’t make the same mistake in future"
270,"Im (35M) and have a brother (30M). From the time I remember, my mom has always favored my brother to me. Whether its getting stuff like toys or games, she would clearly say no to me, while she would go all out and pamper him. We grew up in a middle class lifestyle and while growing up, I had to save up or be thrifty with my spending, while he would splurge and she would keep financially backing him. Recently I had a financial emergency and I asked her if she could lend me some money. She refused. But the following week, my brother wanted to do an international trip and she offered to fund his entire travel. Also, both of us are working with decent salaries. 

I love my brother and want the best for him and while growing up, would always look out for him. I even gave him my car without expecting anything in return. But this constant favoritism from my mom has made me develop some resentment towards him. She is more than happy to insult me, or even make me feel small and insignificant, while with him, its all praise and love. I dont know what I've done to deserve this. I know and try my best to be over and above all this, but its hurting and affecting me in many ways. 

Dear Reddit, I need help and advice on how to handle this situation. Its reaching a level where I feel totally unaccepted and unwelcome in her life."
271,My (19F) boyfriend (22M) called me today and said he can’t talk to me for a bit because of his mental health. He’s in a really bad spot. It breaks my heart because I want to support him but I also know that he needs to focus on himself and a relationship might be too hard right now. Just looking for some advice and steps on what to do next.
272,"PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ. I am very very desperate for advice.


We met in freshman year of high school and weren’t very close up until late 10th grade. We were best friends, we always made references to memes and she treated me very nicely compared to most of the other girls at school. I started gaining feelings for her late 12th grade and I confessed them to her, she basically friend zoned me because she was already with another guy at the time that I was unaware of.  Well I was pretty heart broken and completely distanced myself because I couldn’t see her the same as before because my feelings for her were still there.

Few months later, her then bf cheated on her and broke up with her, and basically she talked to my cousin about how she feels like she missed out on me. And that she wishes things were different. My cousin told me this and I decided to text her and I invited her over during the super bowl with a few of my friends. She seemed very interested in me and basically we started talking and pretty much got together officially about a week or so after that.

Things we great for the first few months, no real issues. Up until I thought she still had feelings for one of our friends (from high school) because of how interested she was in him when we would hang out. She’d always record him majority of the time out of all the group of friends, she wouldn’t really pay me that much attention and would walk ahead of me to keep up with him. I was also a very clingy person because I never had a GF prior to her and didn’t know how to feel. I was probably very insecure or maybe what o thought was true. I don’t know. Regardless, I did find out near the end of our relationship, with no trust and constant arguing that she made a tinder and was also talking to other guys behind my back. She would always lie to me and tell me I was worrying for nothing and that she doesn’t think blocking/speaking up for me when guys would flirt with her was  necessary.

Anyways, I broke up with her after finding all this out. We kept in touch for about a month after until I heard about this friend she met and eventually they got together and I just cut her off completely.

After a few months, people would always tell me she would ask about me, how I’m doing. She would check up on me through other people. I never understood why she wanted to know about me, even after she hurt me. She lied to me and showed me no desire to be with me. I guess after like a month or two with her new BF they broke up.

Well, about 6-7 months later, I hosted this party. I guess she reconnected with one of my best friends who had basically stopped talking to her because of our breakup, and she told me she wanted to come to the party. I told her no, but she ended up calling me and we talked, not necessarily about the party but about why I didn’t want her there. I told her the reasons, I was honest with her. And she seemed understanding about it and was willing to let me
Go because I told her I didn’t want her there.

I ended up changing my mind, I let her come with her friends and we talked at the party, just the two of us. We talked by ourselves in the back of the house and she apologized to me. She said that she wasn’t ready for a relationship, I said I wasn’t either and we both agreed on that. We didn’t talk about getting back together at all, but we were together all night. Talking and even with friends she would lay with me and just wanted me. It felt nice.

Fast forward about 2 months in, she helped me get my life at home kind of on track, she helped me reorganize my home, helped me keep track of my stuff and even went out of her way to just give me things that I would need. I never asked for it but she’s doing all these favors for me and showing me so much effort. I told her I’m willing to try again for a relationship and build up slowly, but she said she wants to build towards a relationship as well but she isn’t ready to have one right now. However, I asked her if we were exclusive and she said yes. We practically make out every time we see each other, we tell each other we love one another and she even comes over to bring me food when we make plans to hang out. I see so much effort yet since my trust with her before was bad, practically no trust at all during our first try at a relationship, that I feel like it’s affecting me now, I feel like that’s unfair to her because I see her trying. 

She brings me around her family, talks about me to her family and even adds me to Group FaceTime’s with her sister. They know we are talking and basically think we are together.

Red flags: she was in contact with her ex who was a issue during our last relationship as well, however as of recently, she had told me he was blocked.

She won’t commit to a relationship as of now, she knows what she wants but apparently she is scared to try. Idk what that means


Please anyone, I’m so upset over this because I love and care for this girl. She tells me she feels the same.

I’m willing to let go of her but only if there is no chance to work with what the circumstances are.

She isn’t a bad person, in fact, she’s great. I love her."
273,"My girlfriend and I have an amazing relationship. We're head over heels for each other and we mess with each other all the time. She hits me, I hit her back, obviously not hard, just playful hitting. We throw verbal jabs at each other as well. We both know that it's all for fun, but I feel like I go too far, even if she says it's fine. Sometimes I recognize I do go too far, and tell her I'm sorry and didn't mean to be hurtful. She had told me multiple times that she knows I'm not trying to be mean, but it bothers me that I go that far. I try not to, but it happens and I feel terrible. I don't know how to stop this behavior, I just get into the moment and keep going. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion, and it really is no big deal. I would really appreciate any input. Thank you."
274,"Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, I’m sort of mid-breakdown at the moment. 

So for context: I have a history of severe depression/anxiety. I was medicated/seeing a psychologist but stopped as I couldn’t afford it. My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months. 

The last few weeks have been pretty rough for me and my boyfriend. He has a very high temper (which he got from his dad) that doesn’t mix well with my anxiety issues. Lately, it’s been getting really bad for us; 2 weeks ago we got into a massive fight because he wanted to go on a holiday in a few months and I told him I probably shouldn’t because I’m saving for a new car.  Then a few days after that another argument broke out because we were going to a friend’s place and I suggested we take seperate cars so we could go home whenever we wanted. Then, just tonight, he completely blew up at me because I didn’t hear something he said. 

It honestly feels like anything I say/do makes him angry and will make him go off at me. It’s gotten to the point where I lay in bed at night thinking to myself why I can’t do anything right, why am I not good enough. All this stress sends my anxiety off too, making me spiral down a horrible train of thought. I’ve really hit rock bottom here. 

Whenever an argument breaks out, we get together and have a conversation about what/why it happened. He always immediately says that he’s so sorry for what he’s done and that he’s going to work on his temper, but so far it’s just all talk. 

I guess the advice I’m asking for is: how do I tell him how this constant fighting seriously affects my mental health without sounding aggressive? There’s only so much more of this that I can take. 

Thank you for reading."
275,"My best friend (m20) probably wants to end his friendship with me (f21).  We have been friends for only a few months, but honestly, it feels as  if he had been my friend forever. He is an amazing person, he is kind,  funny and just incredible to talk to. He has just one issue, he is  severely depressed. Since I myself had depression in my life I know how  hard it is on people and how hard it can be on a friendship. But since  he is such an amazing person I just wanted to help him and I was just  happy to meet a person like him.   
A bit of backstory first: We met through another friend shortly after both of us got out of a relationship. His relationship was abusive and ended with his then gf cheating on him with two guys. Sadly, this relationship just destroyed him and now he has trust issues and his depression became even worse. We bonded over our failed relationship because my first relationship lasting three years was pretty toxic. Because of this first relationship I always yearn to make friends, something I could never do back then. In other words, we were both just depressed people happy to lick each other wounds.   
In the few months that we have known each other I helped him countless times through depressed times and always tried my best to help him. In the last two months his depression took a turn for the worse, he told me a lot of times how he just couldn't trust me and that I should lose his number and that this friendship will just be temporary. Since I knew that these are just things he said while he was depressed and profusely apologized after that every time I never took it badly and just continued to laugh and play games with him and help him if needed.  
But recently, he also began to tell me that I was the root of his depression, since he just couldn't stop compare himself to me. I am in no way better than him, the only thing different between us is that I don't have such severe depression and thus am able to live my life, and manage to go to both Uni and work. I am honestly really horrible with feelings, especially my own, so even if I feel sad I just don't know it, most of the time I just don't feel anything. This is why it always seems as if everything is alright with me mentally, since I just don't care for most things enough to affect me.   
After telling me that he thinks he is such a loser compared to me, I tried to tell him countless times what an amazing person he is, he is funny, incredible kind, and I am always amazed what a hard worker he is for his dream. Sadly, he never believes my word, which is understandable since he was so horribly betrayed and has such severe depression and trust issues.  
After all of that started he started blocking me for a short time again and again since I didn't want to end our friendship just because of a depressed phase of his. Yesterday it began again, but since I was at Uni the whole day I couldn't make sure that he is alright and only could write him back once in a while. He blocked me again after telling me that he promised to leave me alone since I have an exhausting week. But this time he didn't unblock me after a few hours instead he left the groupchats we are in together and hasn't unblocked me a day later.  
I honestly just don't know what to do, and how to proceed with our friendship. Sure, it was sometimes annoying to take care of his mental health and try to help him every time, but he is still such an amazing friend that I would do it again in a heartbeat. The thing I worry the most about that he refuses to go see a psychologist since he had a horrible experience a few years ago. Since it got worse, I also got the feeling that he tries to make me responsible for his mental health, he always told me that I had to find something to make sure that he is alright and things like that.   
What can I do to not only help his mental state, but also preferably save this friendship?

TLDR: My severely depressed best friend is probably cutting me out of his life and I don't know how to help him and preferably save this friendship"
276,"Hi, I'm not sure this will fit here and if it doesn't I'm sorry. (TLDR at the end)

I am having a really difficult time communicating with my house mates at the moment, mainly over financial issues.
I work alongside my studies and the rest of my housemates get financial help from their families. They all have enough for lots of drinking and takeouts and general leisure. I usually have about £20 spare which I set aside to get an uber home if I finish really late at work, or for a small bite to eat if I'm too busy to go home and cook.
We have had some maintenance issues at home and I asked if we could work together for a couple of hours and straighten everything out.  They want to pay someone to sort things out. I pointed out I couldn't afford this and immediately get told to stop making everything about money.

I feel so anxious about this and I just want to know how i can get my friends to understand I am really struggling to keep afloat at the moment?

Tldr: how do i help my housemates understand I cannot afford to pay people to do jobs for us?"
277,Okay so my boyfriend ALWAYS has to “go to the bathroom” before we have sex but he lies to me and watches porn before to get hard. What am I doing wrong
278,"My roommate has her boyfriend over nearly every night. He works 9-5 Monday to Friday and comes over afterwards, she cooks him dinner and either go into the living room or up to her room. They are always up late talking loudly and have sex when she knows I’m up early (6am) for work. He also lives very close to our house. Is it unreasonable to ask her to have him over less or for her to stay at his house some nights?"
279,"First post on reddit so not quite sure how this works. Anyways, this story is quite long and involves quite a few major points so I will try explain it as best as possible and keep to the rules. 

I am an 18 year old male from Australia and am seeking advice regarding an 18 year old girl who I like. I feel as though I should start right from the start so here I go. Back in 2017 I believe it was, me and this girl (I will call her Jane to make it easier) became friends, we went on a school trip around the world for 5 weeks and bonded over many things, we had similar beliefs, tastes in music, friends, etc. I fell for her quite quickly, maybe it was because we were spending lots of time together or just because I felt a real connection with her, but regardless people around me started to notice this as well. People would often comment on how flirty we were with each other, how close we were and her friends were even telling me how they had been speaking with Jane and she had told them that she was interested in me. I didn’t think much of it because I knew that she was currently interested in someone else who was on the program as well. 

Anyways, eventually she ended up getting with (hooking up with) this guy she was “into” (I say into in inverted comas because she regretted it the day after) and I was gutted. Anyways, there was still around three weeks of the program left so I looked over it and just focussed on having a fun time with my friends. Me and Jane ended up getting even closer in these last three weeks, the flirting from her side was increasing a lot and I was getting mixed messages all the time from her. Anyway, on the last night I get a note from her saying how amazing her trip has been thanks to me and how much she has enjoyed becoming close with me, I showed this to some of her close friends who all agreed that this was definitely a sign, she was into me. So, after dinner on the last night, we go to my room and we are having a few drinks and we begin flirting with each other, eventually she asks me if I like anyone and I tell her I like her. Big. Mistake. She turns to me and stutters and says, no be serious who, and I say again, you, she says oh I never realised. Anyway I ask her who she’s into and she says that she doesn’t really like anyone at the moment but there is this guy back in Australia she wants to get with again. The conclusion of that night was that she wasn’t into me, I don’t know how I misread the signals but I got it all wrong.

Some time passes between the trip and eventually the new year comes (2018). Me and some friends had planned a camping trip and Jane had been asking me if she could come on the trip as well (we had remained really close friends despite that awkward night, in fact I would say we had become even closer). I asked my friends who were all friends with her if she could come and they said sure. So me my friends Bill, Lizzy and  ultimately Jane all go on our camping trip. The trip was nice but again she began to give off these signs that she was into me. I asked her friend Lizzy what she thought and she told me not to think about it, Jane was just a little flirty. Anyways, Lizzy and Bill were teasing me and Jane about being a couple and Jane kept getting angry, which was a clear sign that she wasn’t interested. After the camping trip I spoke to Jane’s best friend who told me that she doesn’t really think of me as anything more than a close friend at the moment, but she reckoned with enough time Jane will change. So I waited, I think it was around March when I first noticed the signs, Jane was constantly asking to hang out with me, messaging me till 2/3AM every night, spending all her time with me at school and being extremely flirty. I spoke to one of Janes close friends who said that Jane was into me, so I arranged to meet Jane on Saturday night and we planned to smoke some weed and chill at a friends house. She came over and spent the whole night by my side, we spoke, laughed and had a really good time. I don’t know why I didn’t make a move on her but instead at the end of the night I just told her that I really liked her and again she was taken off guard, but this time for another reason. She seemed unhappy to hear it, she was annoyed at me for saying it and kept hinting to me that she wanted me to make a move instead of telling her this, she told me that she was scared about how our friendship would work if we ended up as a couple and said she needed to think. I gave her time but ultimately she never responded. A couple of weeks later, a friend in my year threw a massive party, me and Jane arranged to meet at the party and then go chill at the park together. When I arrived she was very drunk, I helped her up and stayed with her the entire night. I didn’t want to make a move as I knew it was wrong and it would be taking advantage of her but I always knew that, that was the night. First we spent a good two hours lying next to each other, her head on my chest. Then we went to the party and I stayed outside with her for a good 2 more hours whilst she was vomiting and sobering up. By the time she had sobered up, we walked together for a good 4km to the McDonald’s nearby, her taking my hand and holding it the whole way. By the time we arrived she had told me that she was sober and just wanted to go back to the park with me and chill. However, a friend of hers tagged along with us, as we got to the park (she was now fully sober, just feeling unwell) she began to hug me and grab me a lot and the friend that tagged along even left for ten minutes since he thought we were going to hook up. I don’t know why but I didn’t do anything. Anyways, we get to school on Monday and she tells me she isn’t into me. I was gutted again but I was curious as to why, maybe she was upset I didn’t make a move? Is that something that happens, maybe she got tired of waiting and moved on? 

Anyways, the remainder of 2018 was hell, I remember liking her the whole year and her slowly distancing from me. By the end of 2018 I had settled down and started dating someone else. I like my girlfriend (I will call her Ruby) a lot but I never envisioned us lasting over a year because of my strong feelings for Jane. I always thought (as terrible as it sounds) that ruby would be a quick rebound from Jane. Anyways, eventually I forgot about Jane and fell in love with Ruby. However, a little over four months ago, me and Jane began talking again, properly, as we did in the past. We got the stupid heart thing on snap chat, we stayed up until 2/3AM talking to each other and began flirting with each other as we did in the past. In fact, just a few weeks ago we went to a party together and she was all over me at the party, hugging me constantly, grabbing my hands a lot and giving off very song signals that she was into me. I tried to look over it but since things weren’t going well with ruby I couldn’t. I found myself falling for Jane again, and hard as I tried, I couldn’t help myself. Anyways, me and Ruby had our ups and downs, we split up for a week around a month ago and are currently on another break right now. I don’t know if I want to continue with Ruby, I feel as though I have fallen out of touch with her. At the same time though, I think going for Jane again would be silly and painful for me, as no matter how sure I seem to be about Jane liking me, I always tend to be seeing thing wrong, With all this being said I really do like Jane again, I feel the same way I did about her last time and I am really not sure what to do.

If possible, please someone, offer me advice, whether I should break things off with Ruby and try again with Jane, whether I should stay with Ruby and not try again with Jane. I am feeling very confused and just want some helpful advice. Also, a friend of mine pointed out that he thinks Jane got bored of me being a wimp and not making a move on her and decided to move on, he also said that he thinks Jane is into me now (from all the signs she has been giving) but i argued that those signs don’t mean anything as evident in the past. What do you guys think?

Also can someone please tell me what they think, is Jane into me?"
280,"Yesterday, my boyfriend, my partner, with whom I live together and have built up a life, told me that he didn't love me anymore. When I asked him why, he said: ""Because of your issues.""  
OK, he's right, I'm a mess. Here's that: I have a depression, which I control perfectly well with medication. But it does manifest in pretty much every eating disorder that ever existed. For my partner, I was able to get over a lot of them. However, today, I still (need to) throw up after I eat dinner. That's pretty disgusting, I know.   
But there's more: Because of my issues, we don't have sex anymore - I don't know if it's the depression or the medication against it, but I just don't feel the ""desire"" anymore. All of that must be really hard to deal with as a partner and it just sucks.

On the other hand: I am the most loyal person, doing everything for the people I love - that is, for him. I care about him and for him. I try to do everything I can at home so he feels good. I ""hide"" my depression perfectly well and am always good humored, supportive, and positive - even when he's in a terrible mood. Because I know very well that I have to compensate for being such a mess. 

He, on the other hand, never talks to me. He once said, that he hates talking. That's it. So the only way I found out about him not loving me anymore, was because I asked him, why he had been completely cold and distant the last few weeks.  
Now, I am where I have been before: convinced that it's impossible for anyone to love a mess like me. I thought he could but turns out he can't neither.

How about you - do you have or had partners, that went through stuff with you, no matter how hard? Or did you leave a partner, because it was just to hard?"
281,"I met my gf in college, we instantly feel in love and having been dating for over a year. She’s my best friend and I really want to be with her forever but I truly don’t know if I can be. 

She completely lied to me and our friend group about her past,  she told us so many things that where wrong. 

My problem is I love her dearly and she loves me more than anything but can I really be with a lier? Especially someone who lied so much. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has been lied to this badly by a bf/gf and what happen? I really need help I don’t know what to do."
282,"So the present in question is a stuffed animal that says I love you on it's leg, which my ex gave me in the last few weeks of our relationship. He was not the most supportive or understanding guy and he only gave me the stuffie out of obligation for Valentine's Day.

I don't like my ex and threw out everything he left at my place save for the stuffie because it was cute and I have an attachment to stuffed animals (my room is filled with them and I have a pile on my bed). Instead I just opted to move this one to a hidden corner of my room where I wouldn't be reminded of my ex.

It's just been sitting there for months and I thought maybe I could give it to my current bf who I love very much and I like getting him small gifts.

I'd rather give it away than keep it in case he asks who it's from. I don't want to throw it out because the stuffie did nothing wrong! He doesn't deserve to be tossed away!

I don't have any attachment to the stuffed animal that is related to my ex, I just think it's cute and I think my boyfriend will like it. But he's a bit sensitive and don't know if me giving him something my ex gave me is insensitive.

This is probably a really stupid question but I just don't wanna upset my boyfriend.

Edit: I'll donate the toy. Don't know why I didn't think of this I guess I just have a small brain."
283,"It all started 3 weeks ago, she stopped going to work to take some time for her saying she wasn't sure about her choice of career and I've learned recently it wasn't about that at all... We've been today for almost 2 yr now, we are childhood friend since we're 6yo and when we started seeing each other at first, we both were getting out of a toxic relationship. I've moved in with her only a couple of weeks after we date, and now she's indecisive about what she wants , but I can't handle her being cold for weeks and not even pay attention to me, not even a hello when we see eachother. 

I don't know what to do to help her in this situation, I'm well aware it could be the end of our relationship but in the same time, she just want to have her personal ""bubble"" and says she just want to be alone, yet stay with me since she loves me and she doesn't want to hurt me. I've told her that I wanted the best for her, even if that didn't include me. I can't stand seeing her being so depressed and broken inside... I literally have no idea how to help her or how to act while she decided on what she wants and I can't deal with that for much longer since it's stressing me so much , I'm already at my limit since I've overworked myself to help us get better financially. Got any ideas on how or what should I do? 

I know waiting right now is the best I can do and I  cant see myself losing her right now, she's my world and my everything, I don't want her to feel stressed like I'm pushing her to make a decision. Guys from Reddit, I need your wise advice."

285,"So, I've been married for a long long time. My husband (43m) and I (43f) stopped having sex about 20 years ago. This has been most of our marriage. I've had sex with an old boyfriend once and think about doing it again. This is someone who I've had a lot of sex with in the past. He was my first. We were together a long time. Like, Jr High through HS. I don't want to be with him, I just want to have sex. I love my husband. Is it wrong if I just have sex with the other guy now and then because my husband doesn't want to? I cannot stress enough how my husband will say anything to avoid having sex. Its absolutely insane. He loves me and I know he does but he just really doesn't want to ever have sex. Am I supposed to be celibate for the rest of my life? Why can't I just have sex with my past partner for the sake of having sex now and then? We are both adults and he's game. He's not committed to anyone so that isn't an issue. It's only my guilt because I love my husband dearly. That's the only reason I've stayed with him all these years. Otherwise I'd probably be single and just having sex with my ex all the time. Yes, I realise there is more to a relationship than sex. Which is why I'm still with my husband. But, sex is also good for the soul. I think everyone needs it now and then. I've lived about 12 years without it! 

I've also tried talking to my husband about it and it's just always excuses. So, that won't help. We have also gone to couples counseling and that didn't help either. He literally doesn't have any interest in sex. I am like a jr high girlfriend that's also his roommate and cook. Except I was having sex in jr high and I'm not now! But he's more like a roommate that I love deeply and snuggle with from time to time. Nothing more than chicken pecks for kisses. I don't know? Maybe he's secretly gay or something? He's just not interested in having a real sexual relationship. I believe he knows I had sex with my ex once and he just overlooks it. He sometimes makes kind of backhanded comments about it. Like, it semi upsets him but not enough to confront me about it. I don't know? All I know is that if I'm not having sex with my ex then I'm never having sex again. I don't want to divorce the person I love just because he won't have sex. It's really an impossible situation. I feel horrible thinking about cheating on him. 

Thanks ahead of time for any replies!"
286,"TL;DR: Broke up with gf since i felt unprioritized, not sure i made the right decision, i would like some objective insights

History:

We were in the same class in high school, I've tried to date her but it didn't work out. After 3 years, one day i got drunk and messaged her. When I sobered up i thought i should invite her for a date. We clicked instantly, kissed at the very first date. Almost everything was perfect. When we spent time together it was amazing, but even though she had nothing to better to do, she just didn't want to spend more time together. We met **1**\-2x/week in person but lots of messaging. University started the number of dates were constant, due to the classes we only exchanged messages during the breaks. We had fights sure, but all in all I think we were good. I have to admit I've always felt that i was always the one who wanted more. First to say love you, first to bring up the idea of marriage in the future etc. 3 years passed, it's like it was yesterday that i kissed her the first time.

\[I think is important to the story that she has an amazing relationship with her family.Me on the other hand have basically 0 connection with my family, and I've always lacked friendships as well. I believe this is one of the reason i was the one who wanted more.\]

The last 6 months I have to admit wasn't perfect. We fought over stupid things. We talked it over after 1-2 days, yeah childish behavior but we waited for the other person to write first. Over the months slowly we talked less and less, we met once a week but for a few hours. Also we had less and less sex. We went 4 weeks without having sex.

The last month:

She has found a job that she really like she works like 10 hours a week, oh yeah she's doing her MA aswell. So here we are messaging each other like 4-6 times a day. If she came over she would arrive 8pm and leaves 10am in the morning.(I sleep from 9pm to 5am, she sleeps from 11pm to 8:30-9am). If I wouldn't write her in the morning she would write me at 2pm for the first time in the day. So i'm getting frustrated and 2 weeks ago I wrote her a message during the day that the way things go is really not good and we have to talk about this. I thought it was the only way because we barely met in person. She thought of it as an attack and it was inappropriate so we agreed to talk about it in person. I started reading articles about having a relationship with a busy partner and i found that i should support her and do small little things to keep the communication.( I've always supported her even when her parents didn't.) We did talk, i told her everything and that i want the relationship to work and i only want small changes. She could call me when she commutes and we meet once a week but really do something together and at the weekends she could fully focus on her family and study i wouldn't even message her.  She said she will try but i should be more supportive.

So nothing changed and last week when she came over and we had a small fight prior 2 night before she came over. We talked but didn't resolve anything. Next morning she woke up and I was frustrated since we just slept next to each other. She was starting to leave and i was full and said that i can't take it anymore. Either she changes or it ends now we talked very calmly but eventually it ended.

I joined Tinder don't ask me why, honestly i don't know. Almost a week since i/we ended and i have no idea if i should message her again that i miss her and love her. I guess my question is that should i make contact to her again or try to move on?"
287,"My BF and I are in an LDR. He’s been telling me he wants me to give him more reassurance, i.e say lovey doves things. But that’s just not me. I would never say for example, “you are my world,” because I don’t believe in that. Last night when he answered the phone, the first thing he said was “I’m tired, was just calling to say goodnight.” Then I said, “Goodnight, I love you.” Because if someone tells you they are tired, you let them rest! But he said, “You are not even gonna fight for me to stay on the phone?” Like NO? If you say you are tired and calling JUST to say goodnight, I’m not gonna fight you on it? He got upset with me about that. It’s been like this since the start of the relationship. Before we were long distance, he complained that I wasn’t doing enough for him service wise, now he’s complaining that I don’t give him enough words of affirmation. He says I have to try and go along with his love language, but I show love in my own way. It makes me feel like what ever I do, it’s never good enough for him. Is he just insecure or is this an actual problem that I should be more reassuring and do his “love language?”"
288,"Sorry for the wall of text ahead. We have been together for almost 8 years in April of next year. When I started a new job working from 8-5pm and she worked 8-430pm we decided to car pool in her corolla. It saved us gas and my older Chevy Silverado has a few issues I needed to get fixed on it anyway. This honestly has caused so much issues with her making me late in the morning so many times and we fight all the time about it.

Let me start by saying I’m not a saint. I have a lot of my own issues that I deal with. I’m not a morning person and I’m always in a bad mood in the mornings. I have ruined a lot of mornings for her because of my shitty attitude. I don’t want to try and make excuses for it, I suffer with major depression (this has been diagnosed and I take medication for it) and more than likely some form of a personality disorder however, they tested and ruled out bipolar disorder at the practice I was going to. My medication has changed three different times from the first medication I started taking back in Jan or Feb of this year. The most recent one I’ve been on for five weeks as of tomorrow and it’s not really helping at all and honestly making my mood swings even worse. I have terrible ones and I need to get something that helps me with them (the first medication helped a lot with them but the other two have not). She has been through a lot of bullshit with me because of this.

This morning I got out of the shower and ended up grabbing my towel and smelled it. It wasn’t smelling so good because I had been using it for a few days and I decided I needed a new one. I go into the bedroom where we keep the towels and I put the dirty one in the closet (we don’t have laundry baskets because we just moved into this new apartment and she threw out of the hampers we had before we moved in). I grab a new towel while she is yelling at me from the other bedroom while getting ready for work about how my dirty towel is wet and not to put it in the closet. I ignore her because I’m in a bad mood and I don’t want to have an outburst and ruin the morning again. I just tell her it’s not wet but it’s dirty. She goes into the bedroom and grabs the towel while still yelling at me about how stupid I am and I’m not yelling but telling her why does she have to find something to bitch at me about every morning because it’s wet and goes and grabs the hand towel from the bathroom as well (they’re both white so they get washed together but I’m still getting ready in the bathroom and need it) so I kinda snapped. I told her why in the hell did you grab the hand towel from in here you idiot (I know the way we talk to each other honestly fucking horrible). She is right next to me at this point and she’s trying to shove me (pretty hard I might add) into the bathroom and telling me shut up. I didn’t push her but I told her to stop shoving me and shoved her off of me. She then hits/throws her makeup mirror thing at me and the glass shatters on my left shoulder leaving big and small pieces on my shoulder that cut me. Now the cuts aren’t deep but they do hurt and it left glass shards all over my shoulder and the floor. I tell her to get the fuck away from me and to leave me alone. She slams the bathroom door shut and we get ready for work and leave. This is not the first time this kind of thing has happened either. She has thrown, smacked, hit, punched, and physically hit me before. Again, I’m not a saint and I honestly have emotionally abused her especially a lot lately (I’m trying to get help with the emotional outbursts and mood swings). There was one time she threw a big round marble ball at me and it hit me in the right side of my hip and caused me to have a huge welt/black and blue bruise for weeks after.

The entire way she’s trying to speak to me and I just want to be quiet as to not lose it. I drop her off for work and that’s basically it.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. We seem like to fight every day mainly because of me. My emotional state, depression, and emotional issues don’t help at all and honestly cause a lot of my issues in my entire life. I’m trying medication and I’m trying to get back into therapy as well. I had an appointment this past Monday but someone screwed up making the appointment in the office and scheduled me with a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist to do medication management and therapy so I had to reschedule the appointment. I’m tired of having these issues but I’m trying to get help with them. She has been to the therapist and been on one or two medications but stopped taking them because the person she was going to is an idiot. I found another psychiatrist who can do both therapy and medication management and gave her the number for it (it’s five minutes from our house and closer to her work even) and she hasn’t called them yet. I don’t know what she’s doing with it. 

I feel like I should still be really pissed about this but at the same time stuff happens I guess? I don’t know."
289,If a friends with benefits gets mad at you for having sex with someone else and cuts you off what does that mean? (Keep in mind that he had sex freely with other girls without caring what I think)
290,"I find that I can easily acquaintance myself and be friends with just about anybody, but I havent really managed to make a whole lot of best friends. 
     
Im (17F) and I moved to this new town at 15. I havent made one best friend, haven't hung out with one person outside school, at lunch Im barely scraping, at social events, games.
     
People have said these things about me either to my face or behind my back
""mean and intimidating""
""Most sweetest caring girl ever""
""Always happy and upbeat"" 
So its a mix on how people see me. Anyways I just dont know what to do. I try to make closer friends but its like I wasnt born with that skill."
291,"Yesterday my wife sent me a link ( https://aceweek.org/about/asexuality ) and in the evening asked if I had read it yet. I told her I had not had a chance yet. She said she falls under the gray sexual umbrella, and to read it. We have been married for 5 years now and until recently we were both hyper sexual. Or at least it seemed that way. Sex multiple times a day more often than not. after she had a hysterectomy two years ago the amount of sex we had dropped significantly, to now maybe once or twice a month. Sometimes it will be months without as well.  The fact that for the last several years I have been a OTR truck driver and only am home for 5 or 6 days a month used to not be a problem and I think might be why it took so long to understand that this could be why her sex drive never came back. I don't know where we go from here either."
292,"My [45f] husband [Stan, 45m] had an affair with a co-worker [50f... I will call her Karen because she looks like she wants to argue with a manager] 10-12 years ago. We separated. I wanted to divorce; he wanted counseling. After a few years apart and the initiation of divorce proceedings we went to counseling. It was immediately, surprisingly effective. We fixed a lot of things I hadn't known were broken in our relationship. 

During our time apart we each dated and he and Karen were serious for awhile but they mutually split up. He was probably too honest with me about all his interaction with her (I can tell you her favorite cocktail, her natural hair color, and her favorite sex position). Because of that brutal honesty (including about one slip up shortly after we reconciled) I tend to believe him. 

So Stan and Karen still work together. It bothers me.  He is in a really specialized field with limited job openings. He applies for 4-5 jobs a year and is generally rejected as being overqualified. I don't want to move out of state so I deal with them working together. 

About a year ago he self-reported that he had driven her home from work one day when her car was in the shop. I didn't care that much. 

So...today...I've been on a business trip for a week. Not uncommon due to time zones, etc for us to only text or have brief calls while I'm gone. I called him tonight and he told me that four days ago he was in a fairly serious car accident in Karen's neighborhood- 30 miles from our house. He quickly gave some reason why he was there (she had inadvertently taken his iPad home from work instead of hers after they had sat next to each other in a meeting and the problem was discovered after her child was asleep so he went to get it from her house.  She was not going to work the next day and he wanted his iPad back.).

I don't like that it took him four days to tell me about something bad that happened to happen to him on her street. 

Rational-me wonders if he would normally have called me to let me know immediately, or if the dynamic of our relationship is such that he would have told me after the fact if the wreck occurred on our own street.  He wasn't hurt. (He did text me that day saying ""bad day. Tell you about it later. Hope you're ok"")  And he did tell me the first time we had voice-to-voice conversation. (well, the second...but the first time he called I answered the phone by saying I was too busy to talk)

Irrational-me can't sleep and wonders if he's been cheating on me the whole ten years since we got back together. 

Should I be worried here? Does the fact that I'm even questioning this mean I should pull the plug on the marriage?  There have maybe been two times in the past decade that I've questioned whether I could trust him. But this one bothers me."
293,"So my sister (18) and I (20) have a distant relationship. She has a good head on her shoulder but bad friends and environment. Being her bigger brother I care and try to protect her. Recently she's been trying to get help and remove herself from these people, especially her best friend who introduced her to coke. 

She went to a friend's house whose a drug dealer the other night to get closure and cut off contact for good. I was furious the last time they were hanging out, they spiked her Xanax, her friend almost died and she almost did too if it weren't for me nursing her. Her friend pressured her to go and the relationship there is toxic. Anyways after an intervention I had with her she admmited that she can't live around those people anymore. She told me the guy drugged her is a known drug dealer with a warrant out for his arrest.

I wanted him gone for almost killing her and thankfully for her friend being there, she wasn't sexually taken advantage of. I gave an anonymous tip to 911 and posed as thier neighbor. They said they dispatch officers shortly. He has an active warrant out for his arrest and is carrying a large amount of cocaine. 

Now that happened I'm afraid for my sister. because what if the dealer comes for her. I told her cut ALL contact. And I have to stay outside of her work which is a bar he knows where she worked at, when she gets off at 2am to make sure she's safe until she gets a new job. 

I'm worried sick about her. Any advice?

Nothing would outright tell the dealer that she had to do something with his imminent arrest, or maybe not idk."
294,"Company I work for is going thru bankruptcy and my supervisor quit, got a triple promotion with shit raise, and this massive financial model for 50 companies is all on me. I have an underlying insecurity that nepotism got me where I am so it makes me uncertain of my future here as leadership changes are being made. I know its time I step up and work late, study finance at night, and dont stop until this is over but i cant focus completely on work over fear that I’d be letting my relationship with my fiance (6 yrs) slip. 

The timing of all this comes at a time where I let my jealousy show again and confronted her about stupid shit I’ve been overthinking. This wasn’t the first time and she of course got pissed. I apologized and again told her id stop and give her the trust she deserves. She’s back to normal but I cant stop overanalyzing little things and thinking she’s still upset. I have been giving her space and doing things like cleaning and making her dinner but i cant shake the feeling that she’s not being genuinely happy. 

Im just feeling weak with everything going on but that’s not the man i want to be. I want to be able to self motivate myself and make myself happy like I have always done before we met. She is the strong independent type and i love that about her and she loves it when I’m the same. We have always been like that and I want it to stay like that. I just want her to come around on her own without any pressure. This was more of a vent but if anyone has something to add id appreciate the read."
295,"This is so childish but yeah. Bit of a back story. This guy and I used to work together for like 6 months. We didn't interact much but I always thought he was cute. He left the job in March but recently he worked on a project where he was our client so he visited for a few meetings. We had some short conversation but just small talk. 
I recently broke up with my long term boyfriend and I am doing just fine, but I feel like I really need a fling or something. I want to get out there. Anyway... So this guy came in today for his close out meeting. I wanted to find a way to interact with him and make catch his attention, maybe let him know I am single, but couldn't.... Feel so dumb. So I was thinking, would it be weird and totally destined to failure if I just leave him a message ? I have his phone nr. And email and everything. The thing is, I don't even know if he s single or not. He was when he was still working with me, but now I don't know. I normally don't do this, but I am working on the new me and the new me is totally a badass and goes after what she wants. I am afraid I will make myself look like a fool if he doesn't reply or of he's with someone. Man that would be a mess. But, a crush is a crush and he's getting hotter and hotter in my mind every day.
So, Reddit, what's your advice?"
296,"I love my boyfriend very much, but he is not very thoughtful. We have been living together for about 2 years (been together 4), and I regularly go out of my way to do nice things for him, cook him meals that he likes, and pick up things that he needs from the store. I get excited about giving him gifts for his birthday or holidays. 

He is very sweet to me in other ways, but this sort of thing is not his strong suit... He has a good full time job and is helpful around the house in the morning. However, once he is done working for the day, he likes to smoke weed and stay on the couch. While I understand this is his way of unwinding and don't think there is anything necessarily wrong with it, it does make him pretty forgetful and unmotivated to do things with me or for me. 

On multiple holidays, his gifts for me have arrived late and he has just handed me the package once it arrived in the mail instead of wrapping it like it's a surprise. Although they were nice gifts, it felt very last minute instead of something he really put thought and effort into. He doesn't do ""little things"" to surprise me or make me happy (ex buying flowers, planning a date). 

On a much more basic/daily level, it seems like he is oblivious to the types of things that he sees me buy every week, aside from the things that he eats/uses. I work full time and take night classes, but I still do all of the grocery shopping and cooking. Typically, I bring him his dinner while he watches TV or browses reddit (maybe he will see this...) It would be so nice if once and a while he would think to cook me a meal, or to ask me if there was anything I needed.

Anything to show that he is thinking of me or wants to take care of me when I am busy or stressed would mean so much to me! I have told him this multiple times before, but I hate doing it because i feel like I sounds selfish and ungrateful so i end up shying away from how strongly I really feel about it. When I have talked to him about this in the past, he agrees and says he will try harder, but then nothing really changes. It breaks my heart to tell him that I am not happy with our relationship, especially since he hasn't really done anything wrong. Am I being too picky here? How should I be explaining this to him?  If anyone else's SO's are like this, how do you feel about it?

TL;DR - my boyfriend does not put forth the same amount of effort as I do in terms of doing nice things and taking care of each other. How can I get him to be more thoughtful?"
297,"My younger brother and my mother's fiance of 12 years have never gotten along. We'll call fiance Dan and my brother Robert. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dan is your typical ultra-conservative dude -- backwards views on race, misogynistic, gun-toting, basically rough around the edges. Initially there was some fear on my part that he could become abusive if he didn't get his way, but I have seen no evidence of this. He is a very hard worker and takes great care of my mom, which is why I have always been a fan of his and told my mom he was good for her.  For some background, my mother and I are generally conflict-averse; we go along to get along and keep everyone happy. He is the polar opposite and always says what he thinks no matter what anyone says or where he is which I find refreshing and my mother finds, let's say, difficult at times. That said he is the longest relationship she has ever had and no matter how much they butt heads they always wind up making up.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert is a bit of a failure to launch. He is a pretty smart guy but lacks self-confidence and is the most stubborn person I've ever met. Once he has decided what he thinks of someone it will never change no matter what. From the very start he and Dan did not get along; when they got together I was 20, my brother was 18 and we both lived with my mom. This was antithetical to his worldview in which men move out at 18, or sooner, and ask nothing of their parents unless they're dying on the street. He made his lack of respect for the both of us obvious. He didn't outright say we were useless or try to kick us out but his opinion was clear. In my view this didn't really matter or affect my opinion of him. To my brother it meant he was abusive and trying to get between he and my mom. Robert tried to get me on his side so we could both tell my mom to leave him but I always told him it is not our place and while Dan is kind of a dick, mom seemed happy and he loved her.

&amp;#x200B;

Life moved on. I moved out into a shitty apartment and worked restaurant/delivery jobs for a while before finding a career at a big company as a wage slave. Robert stayed with my mom for a while, then she moved him into one of her properties where he lives now. He has bounced in between jobs and has trouble staying in one for various reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had moved out of state and put down roots. My mom moved to the same state a few years later and brought Dan along with her. Robert stayed behind living in her property rent-free. This was a constant source of argument between Dan and my mom -- he told her she was coddling him, she said she couldn't make him homeless, he said supporting him his entire life is not her responsibility. I do tend to agree with Dan on this because my brother is the type to take advantage of the situation and not do extra work unless forced. However, my mom has a big heart and there's no way she was going to kick him out outright so I always told Dan he should lay off and just accept it if he wants to stay with her. This is a futile argument to make with him because like I said, he says what he thinks no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago I met my now wife and asked my brother to come meet her and see the rest of the family in the state. While here, he stayed with my mom and Dan -- which turned out to be a huge mistake. I should have had him stay with me but I had roommates at the time so my house was pretty full. He was staying in an RV next to their house. The entire time he was visiting he complained endlessly about Dan ""ruining"" our mom, turning her into a different person, keeping her from him, etc. etc. which the GF and I mostly rolled our eyes at. Trying to convince him otherwise was pointless and we both knew it within five minutes of trying. The fact was she had offered to move him out there many times and help him find a job and get his own place but he refused. 

&amp;#x200B;

This sets the stage for ""the event"". When I think about this night it's like the climax of a Stephen King novel where everything that has been bubbling up the entire book explodes at the same time. It's one of those life-changing events that are unexpected, tragic and hard to rationalize. I wasn't present so this is secondhand from my mom, my grandfather, Dan and Robert.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother was in the RV next to the house drinking, apparently a lot. Not an uncommon occurrence (for either of us if I'm honest). He saw Dan's truck coming down the driveway (it's a long driveway -- the home is on a lot of acreage and the RV had a full view of the driveway). Dan's account is that as he was getting out of the truck, Robert came running up to the window yelling that he hated him, was going to kill him unless he left forever, and was trying to jump through the truck window to attack him. Robert owns a revolver and according to Dan, said that he had it on him and would shoot him if he didn't leave. Dan keeps a firearm close at hand at all times and had one in his truck; he told my brother he'd better get back into the RV before he did something he regretted. Robert continued screaming at him, saying he was going to kill him, yelling expletives, but did run back into the RV at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert's version of this part of the story is that he did run out and tell Dan that he needed to leave because he was a bad person and did not deserve our mom (I am censoring his commentary a bit here). He says he did not threaten him and did not have his revolver on him and that Dan then pulled out his firearm, pointed it at him and told him to get away from him before he shot him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these stories are hard for me to believe, because I've never known either to actually get in a fight or threaten anyone, except for one thing -- when I saw my brother later in the night, he was very intoxicated and still ranting about the situation. This makes me think he may have not been in total control of his actions due to drinking. Drinking is never an excuse for behavior, but it can be an explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, Dan went into the house and was talking to my grandfather who was also staying with them at the time. This part of the story is confirmed by my grandfather. Robert comes running back into the house, with his gun drawn, points it at Dan and again tells him to leave or he will shoot him. Leaving aside the fact that it is not as simple as just ""leaving"" because after a 12 year relationship, their entire lives are entertwined, a fact my brother cannot seem to grasp, he has just threatened a man in his own home in a state with very favorable self defense laws. Dan pulls his own gun but does not point it; he tells Robert again to go back into the RV and sleep it off or he would regret it. Robert is incoherent at this point and just yelling expletives over and over; he's on the edge and unpredictable. Dan's response is to step forward and backhand him. He fell and his head hit the edge of one of the steps on the stairs behind him. Dan decided to remove himself from the situation, got back into his truck and went to a hotel for the night.

&amp;#x200B;

During this, my mother was out running errands. My GF and I were hanging out at the house when I got a frantic call from my mom saying Dan had attacked Robert and he was bleeding from the head. We rushed over and met them at the house. As stated earlier, Robert was very intoxicated, still ranting about Dan being violent, attacking him for no reason, that he was abusing our mom, etc. We took him to the urgent care where he got a couple of stitches for the head wound but did not have a concussion. He complained for a long time that he had weakness on the left side of his body but either he was lying or it was psychosomatic because there's no real medical reason for it. He also maintains that he did not have his gun at any point in the night but I am inclined to believe my grandfather's account.

&amp;#x200B;

After this my mom basically said both of them had overreacted, it was a ridiculous situation she should not have to deal with, and almost did leave Dan over it but as usual they made up. To my brother this is the ultimate betrayal. He has not visited since the incident and constantly harasses my mom by text saying she never loved him, has chosen Dan over him, and refuses to even see her for holidays unless she splits with Dan. The texts he sends are pathetic, to be honest, but it really tears my mom apart and has caused her a lot of depression, lack of sleep, self-doubt, etc. which is crazy because she is an amazing mom and does not deserve this at all. She has accepted his binary that she can either choose Dan or her son. My position has been that he made his choice just like anyone else and has to live with it, but does not get to force a choice on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I married my GF two years ago and we have a son who is 15 months old. My brother has basically just added that to his ammunition literally saying that she is preventing him from seeing his nephew because she will not leave Dan. This part is infuriating to me; not only has he not even met his own nephew due to his own childishness, he is using him as a weapon against our mom to make her feel even worse. That has made it even more personal for me because in my opinion, my brother has no place using my son as a way to get what he wants.

&amp;#x200B;

So, RA, any advice for me here? I'm honestly not sure what advice could be given because there's no talking to my brother. He only responds when he feels like it, has not answered a text from me in months, and goes weeks at a time without responding to anyone. I know that he is also depressed and has threatened suicide in the past. I think that is just more mind games but I guess you never know, which is what makes it effective. I've told my mom she should just cut him off entirely, kick him out of her property and sell it, let him deal with the consequences of his actions. I hate to tell her to do that and I kind of feel like a dick for turning on my own family, but what he has done is unacceptable to me. Most recently, my mom has offered to fly him out here for Thanksgiving because Dan will be gone on a two week business trip, so he could meet his nephew and not have to see Dan. His response is that ""it will make you think you can just send him away for a week to see me whenever you want to so you don't have to leave him"". So yeah. That's where he's at. My bio dad and stepmom are coming to visit over Christmas and he will be housesitting for them. He said that he would not do it if she tried to go and visit him. After all of this my wife has said she does not want him to meet our son regardless of what happens, and it's tough for me to disagree. I texted him yesterday telling him that he will never meet his nephew unless he apologizes to my mom and basically does whatever she wants him to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it's just heartbreaking and I don't have a good solution. There probably is no good solution and I get the feeling my mom is going to ultimately give him what he wants. If that happens I do intend to go no contact with him and he will not be a part of my family."
298,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on how to deal with this situation with my mum.

A bit of background... I am very close to my mum and she's my main support system and go-to person when I'm struggling. I have been living away from home in another country for the past three years, and our relationship has had its ups and downs (specifically in the past year).

The ""downs"" in our relationship are mainly caused by her very unhealthy body image issues and her projection of this onto me and the other members of our family (especially my dad). For as long as I can remember she has made snide comments at the dinner table, heavily encouraged dieting and commented on any amount of weight gain/loss. This means that when I do go home to visit I get very anxious that she will say something so I try to diet beforehand (I'm very fit and work out several times per week but I am on the curvier side - by no means at an unhealthy weight).

I also struggle with the fact that when I call home, the majority of our conversations are about my dad and their relationship. She likes to vent to me about how useless he is/how she's considering leaving him/how their therapy sessions are going etc. I did tell her a few months ago that hearing all of this makes me really anxious and that I think it would be better if she spoke to a friend or a colleague. It stopped for a while but then went back to how it had been before.

It's not as simple as cutting her out of my life because in many ways she's great and supportive, however, I'd really like to be able to prevent or protect myself better from the toxic aspects of our relationship. Any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: mum (f55) talking to daughter (f21) about relationship problems with dad (m60)"
299,"My husband and I have been together for 6 years now. Very good relationship, my best friend. Any disagreement we can sit down and maturely talk it through and always come to a compromise or agreement. 

I love him dearly. Everything about our relationship is pretty perfect.

About a year ago, I started feeling depressed. Hair falling out, sex drive started deceeasing, distanced myself, etc.

This summer it got really bad. We were in the middle of buying a house and lived with my Mom. That stress was so bad. My depression hit an all time low and I had so many panic attacks. One night I remember laying on the floor absolutely bawling for 2 hours.

I had enough and went to a doctor. Everything came back healthy, but yea they diagnosed me with depression. Birth control and anti-depressants.

My hair has started growing back. I tear up looking at all the new hairs. I do not feel as horrible anymore and we bought a house. I feel a little like my old self and even joined a gym with my best friend.

However, my Husband is struggling with our sex life. I just have no desire to have sex unless I initiate or we talk about it beforehand.

Last month we had sex 3 times, twice in one day. It was great and positive. 

The major problem is he does not understand that him being all over me and being cuddly with a raging boner does not help me. He says he is not expecting sex and is not wanting anything, he just has a boner, but still wants to cuddle me. And he just does not understand that I feel pressured by that.

It really hurts because I'm REALLY trying here. I help him out when he is turned on and I do not want to do it. I got medicated to get me back on track, joined a gym, clean up more, made new friends, etc.

I just feel like I'm not being given the time to fully heal and he is not giving me the personal, physical space. And he constantly brings up sex. It makes me want to cry, it is a reminder that I cannot perform right now.

What did I do?

Tldr: Husband keeps being touch feely with me with a boner when I just want space while I improve my mental health."
300,"Today it really took a toll on me that’s why I’m writing. She works at an inventory company and yes I understand they don’t get done with work until they finish a store. I’m completely understanding of her end time of work being random. However lately, in the last month, she’s been working SO MUCH I never get to see her and it’s causing us to argue and we can’t make up and talk about it because, she’s always at work. She’s been getting up at 3-5am (which is normal) and then working until 7-9 pm which is pass our daughters bedtime sometimes. And she has to be up again at 3-5 the next day so she sleeps right away. We get to eat a meal and then sleep and sometimes I drive her to work. Otherwise I never see her outside of that. Everyone keeps telling me to stop getting in the way of her making money and even she tells me that. She’s taking it as I’m being controlling and want to control her life. But to be 100% honest I cried the entire drive home because I feel like I’m losing my best friend. She can’t really text me during work most of the time either so I really have no communication. I feel like I get half an hour to get our talking in. It’s seriously getting to me, I barely have the energy to be a dad and I don’t want our daughter thinking we don’t love her. I’m trying to talk to her but I’m not sure what else to do."
301,"So I (17f) dated this guy (17m) around a year ago, and our relationship was close to perfect. I eventually ended things because I was being homeschooled and my mental health was not where it needed to be. We tried to stay friends after the breakup, but my best friend texted him saying that he needed to leave me alone and that she knew what I wanted more than me. This wasn’t all that surprising because she was always jealous that my attention wasn’t fully on her. I ended my friendship with her and I really want to message my ex with (hopefully) no drama. I truly love him so much even though it’s been a year. He used to write me letters which I still have and read pretty often. I’ve kept all our pictures and texts, and I just really miss him. I hid all of his things in a box and tried to move on without all the constant reminders, but it doesn’t work. He’s always on the back of my mind. How can I reach out to him if I’m not sure if he’s angry because of my friend? Where would I even start? What would I even say?"
302,"We've been dating since New Years and have been great together. She had a meltdown the other day and said she felt like we were doomed if we weren't on the same page. It came out of nowhere. Despite the short time we have been pretty inseparable. We joke and say I live with her, but don't live together. Because I have my own house that I almost never at.

I got an feeling that I couldn't shake and felt compelled to check her phone. I have her pin and my mine is never lock because we always maintained that we have nothing to hide. Boy was I wrong. 

After a quick glance, and I mean quick, I saw she was talking to a guy today on Instagram.  She beautiful and I know thirsty guys are always after her. She would even show me off her phone their silly attempts. This one was different. I didnt read anything but saw the eggplant emoji and her response with heart eyes and scrolled up to see videos she send in August. 

That was enough for me to get out of bed at 3am and get my shit and get out. 

She woke up as I leaped out of bed and realized I had been on her phone. She got up and said annoyed ""oh you went through my phone?!"" 

I only said by as I left. 

Later she text me and said she has trauma that make her this way and she need counseling. She said it was only to two guys that are out of state and only sent clothes photos to her ex. I told her we were through and text back and forth for a bit. I'm mad but didn't put her down in any way. Just told her I don't understand how she could do this to me. 

I danced around trying to overlook all this but she helped remind me the after the trust is broken things are never the same.

I even messaged her to see if her and her son needed a ride to work and school this morning because she doesn't have a car, but sounds like someone else is already to the rescue.

This is worse than any nightmare.


Edited for spelling errors. I'm shaking"
303,"So I [24 M] recently started hooking up with this girl [22 F], and I like to give as much as I like to receive. I come to find out that not only has she never had an orgasm with another guy, but has never gotten off period. As a guy, I can’t relate and have no idea what to do. Ive tried everything that I know, and she basically wants to skip everything and go right to the part guys typically enjoy, as it’s her favorite part. I don’t feel right when I’m the only one getting off, and it just doesn’t seem fair. If anyone has a similar experience or has managed to overcome an issue like this, it would be appreciated."
304,"The title basically says it all. 

I have been living in an apartment with my best friend for almost one year. We live outside of the US, and our lease does not expire. 

I have been with my boyfriend for longer than I have been living with my best friend but we agreed to move in together before my boyfriend and me became official.

Living together with her is working okay, we have our disagreements in cleaning and expenses but it works out. My boyfriend and I spent every night together, a little more time in my apartment but almost half of the nights in his. He shares his apartment with 3 roommates and one of them is almost unbearable. For this reason we prefer spending time at my place but my roomie is okay with this.

The apartment we rent is technically not made to be used the way we use it, our rooms are connected by a door, my other door leads right into our hallway but her other door leads into another hall outside of our apartment. It is also a separate hallway that only we and our immediate neighbors can access. Her room is a good amount bigger than mine but I was happy with giving her the bigger room because she already had a couch that would not have fit into the smaller room.

My boyfriend and I are very serious, we are talking about marriage and adopting a dog and stuff like that. Our next step is moving in together and we would both do that rather sooner than later. 

The apartment I’m renting now would be absolutely perfect for my boyfriend and me. It is exactly in our price range and we both love it. 

The problem is, my friend and I are both on the lease. I do think it would be really difficult for her to find a different roommate here because of the connecting door. It only works because I don’t have any issues with her walking through my room. 
 The thing is I really don’t know how to approach this. I am scared that it will damage the friendship and I don’t want to hurt her by telling her I don’t want to live with her anymore. 

Can anyone please give me advice on this?"
305,"For some background, me and this girl have been dating for 4 months now, and we have been close friends for about 8 years. We’re in a distanced relationship during the school year (I go to school in Los Angeles, she goes to school in Irvine), but back home we live about 2 minutes away from each other and see each other often.

Our relationship, for the most part, has been great. We talk to each other every day, we’re always very supportive of each other and help each other with our problems, the sexual stuff (even when we’re not together) is amazing, and we’re able to communicate our issues with each other and be very clear and honest about problems we’re having. 

However, the main problem we’ve had is that I would always be scared of making her angry due to her having a very short temper. In the past, I’d anger her by not really thinking of what I said when I’d bring up a problem I had, and that would cause things to escalate very quickly into arguments. Another issue is that, because I overthink and am very anxious person, I often stress about our relationship even if there’s nothing to stress about. I’ve addressed these issues with things like therapy and talking it out with her, but they still give me problems to this day.

So, the issue at hand in this post all began with me being annoyed at her for not telling me she was going to a dinner that night (for context, I had just taken a midterm and said beforehand that I wanted to talk with her afterwards on my walk back, but because she keeps her phone away at social events, she didn’t say she was at a dinner until I’d already gotten back). From there, I waited until she got back to call her, and once I did, I voiced my thoughts, which started in a very annoyed and heated manner but eventually mellowed out. However, the conversation then shifted to me realizing I was basically getting mad at her for nothing and how I make her feel bad because of it.

And after that point, I absolutely fell apart. While in the past I’ve gotten very emotional about things like not being able to see each other and my anxiety, this was a whole other level of breakdown. I sobbed to her for a solid 30 minutes about things like how I felt like I’m always scared of messing up in the relationship because of how she’d get mad at me, how I feel like I basically have to be perfect 24/7 to keep things good between us, and that I hated myself for always overthinking and stressing about nothing. 

Her responses were along the lines of “Breathe” and “But that’s not healthy babe”, but for the most part she was pretty quiet, which I only assume was because it was a lot for her to process. The main thing she said that worried me was that we were already close before this relationship and that we could basically still be like this as friends. She ended the call by saying she felt hurt by my breakdown and didn’t feel like talking anymore, but there were no real hard feelings to my knowledge.

My worry is that she thinks that this relationship is not healthy for me and causes nothing but worry and stress because of her, when in reality it doesn’t, at least not anymore. The issues I talked about were already discussed in the past and have been mostly resolved, and I truly feel happy being in a relationship with her. It just all came out in a very overwhelming way and really got to her, so now my question is how do keep this relationship from going back to a friendship? As early as it sounds, I truly want a future with this woman and I have no more problems with our relationship, but now she believes she’s the cause of all my issues. I don’t want to lose what I have with this girl, she means so much to me and is honestly why I’m still alive. 

Please, help me out."
306,"This may be the wrong place to ask for help about this but here goes.

Context: My friend has been diagnosed with depression and come from a family with a neglectful, strict, verbally abusive father. She is on medication but I'm not sure if friend takes them properly. She has attempted suicide multiple times before. She also overly attached to this guy she dated in the past. 

I have been there for her for years, offering advice, offering a hearing ear, trying to console her meeting up with her every once is a while (weekly as much as possible) I'll admit I lose my patience every now and then, but recently it's been getting too much for me. 

She keeps texting her ex and when her ex asks her to stop or asks her to get help she breaks down. She keeps overloading herself with school work and ends up worse. She's convinced that she cannot help her circumstances. 

All my advice and help seems to get thrown out of the window. It's a cycle of:

A)fuck up or shitty thing that happened
B) me giving her emotional support and advice
C) friend gets better for a day but ignores advice 
D) repeat

It's taking a toll on me. I stay up late just to try to get her to reason it out, or at least talk it out, but she avoids the topic or changes subject just when we're getting somewhere

I get that it's not entirely her fault, I've been there and it's really hard to break the cycle, but I'm worn out and I feel like I'm being taken for granted, since she only ever talks to me about her problems and gossip.

I would love to hear any advice on how to help her. I feel like I should just leave her to sort it out on her own, because she has to learn to deal with it herself, but I'm afraid of what might happen if she fails

She's seen different therapists over the course of a few year and to no avail.

TLDR; Idk how to help a clinically depressed friend and am running low on patience and energy, and feel like I'm being taken from granted."
307,"I'm in a situation where I am newly seperated from an abusive marriage and I have a friends with benefits that I have been spending time with for the last 4 months. My friends with benefits has pursued me for months to let me know that they were interested in me. I did not look for any arrangement as I was dealing with the separation. I thought it was going to be a experimental thing and that after a few times, we would fizzle out but our relationship has grown into something very intimate. 

We see each other every day, we go on dates, we shower together, we talk about our lives, we share all of our meals (He works a few buildings over), he took care of me when I have got sick, there are days that we meet up and don't have sex but spend the day cuddling. It's gotten to the point where he gets jealous of the attention that I get from other guys. He gets very insecure and snippy if he thinks that there's competition. 

The catch is that he has an ex girlfriend that moved to a foreign country abruptly to pursue a new life that he is still in love with. He told me that in 3–4 years that he wants to try to wait for her to come back so that he can marry her. She does not speak to him much but he still carries a torch for her. He mentioned that she left because he is poor and that the break up left him broken. When she gets bored and need attention, she contacts him. He drops everything for her. 

When I have tried to distance myself from him because I have developed feelings ( I have also told him so) he begs me not to go anywhere because he says I mean so much to him. When I have outright asked him how he feels about me he either clams up or says that we don't need labels or titles. This is beyond the no strings attached phase, this feels weird. His actions don't match his words at all. What should I do? Does he have romantic feelings for me or not? Is it worth competing with basically a “ghost”?"
308,"We’ve known each other for about 3 years. Go to a small high school in New Hampshire (120 kids in the grade). Been friendly for a while and these last 3 months got super close. Flirted for a while. We finally hooked up and started dating about 3 weeks ago. She’s been acting distant for about a week and texted me this morning and said she’d like to return to being best friends.  

I know I’m letting her walk all over me. It’s not healthy. I’m usually a strong person but I just can’t find my spine because of how much I love her. 

I don’t know how possible this is because I am truly in love with her and can’t find a way to get rid of my feelings. Also that friendship thing seems like BS because she then avoided me all day. 

There were so many red flags. Never been in a relation for more then 2 months. Started flirting with me while still dating her ex. Repeatedly confessed her feelings for me but told me she didn’t want to date yet. 

I know this is my fault for ignoring those signs. 

Few questions: 

How do I stop letting her walk all over me?

Should I stay friends with her? 

How do I move on to another girl when I feel like there’s no one else. 

I know y’all will make fun of me for saying I’ll never find someone I love again when I’m only 18, but that’s what it feels like. 

Thanks"
309,"Tl;dr: My girlfriend, who once was an ambitious, energetic, and rather successful person, has dropped everything to focus on school, yet is getting the lowest marks she’s ever gotten. She has a history of depression/suicidal thoughts and is slowly letting it consume her again. How do I support her from a few cities away while I’m at university?

A bit of background (sorry if it’s long, I might go on tangents cause I just love her and every bit of her):

We met in December last year at an event hosted at my high school and instantly hit it off, ended up going out about 4 days after meeting (she goes to a different school, I was taking a gap year at the time). 

She was energetic, outgoing, ambitious, and just full of life. It intimidated me because I initially felt that she was toooooo good for me. It was a risk we took getting into a relationship as I had just gotten out of one, and she has a ton of extra curricular commitments, but our honeymoon-infatuated-phase didn’t not disappoint. We realized soon enough that we got pretty lucky with one another; she was the spark and motivation in my otherwise uninteresting life, and I was able to keep things fun but grounded for her.

We talked a lot initially about her past experience with an emotionally abusive boyfriend who manipulated her because of his own insecurities (would be unreasonably jealous, would make fun of her if she tried to put herself out there, etc.) as well as her more or less Asian Tiger Mom (only focused on image, cared very less about the actual process of becoming “successful”). She also told me that she used to be severely depressed in Gr10 and kept that terrible relationship because in her mind, it was validation that she needed while being internally weak.

I got a good understanding of her experiences and upraising, and I really looked up to her for climbing out of her slump and taking charge of her own life. She claims it’s from a program which she joined. It seemed like joining an intellectual environment full of ambitious people rubbed off on her and really gave her the right mindset to work on herself. It also helped her progress her passion for understanding psychology and the way people think and therefore act (this part rubbed off on me tbh). Having given this aspect of humanity thought, it gave our relationship a more stable foundation as we understood why we were in a relationship, what we’re looking for, and ultimately how to have an effective one.

They’re pretty cliché but the basis is that

-we want to feel the love and belonging humans crave

-we need each other to be hardworking and passionate so we keep growing and changing for the better as a couple, as well as individually 

-and no matter what, open communication, respect, and believing that we were each other’s best friend was the grease on the gears

During my gap year we were pretty much inseparable. I realized this is the woman I want to live and experience life with - the one I want to start a family with. 

The problems came when I left in the fall for university, and her older brother left the country for work. Her demons came back, and given the fact that she transferred into a new school for a fresh start in gr12 made her succumb to loneliness. Furthermore, she dropped most of her prestigious programs that used to make her stand out from the rest in order to focus on school more. Unfortunately, her marks are way below her standards, despite studying day in and out (she used to get 90s and now it’s in the 70s). I would give a majority of my time outside school to tutor her as well. Honestly, I’d be depressed in her situation, but here are a list of rational reasons of what I think is affecting her:

-lack of physical comfort (her brother and I used to be by her side 24/7)

-loneliness (most of her friendships are shallow, not much opportunity to be vulnerable + new environment)

-a massive drop in grades despite dropping everything and becoming a “regular” person in her words

-university pressure and general pressure from her mother’s ideology

I’ve tried talking to her many times, and I have been giving her a lot of my studying time just to be present with her and talk to her. However, it doesn’t stop her from thinking that she’s a complete failure and there’s no point in living (she has mentioned suicide multiple times). 

I’ve told her daily how much she means to me, and a lot of other people too. I showed her I’m willing to stay till the end, and give her any support she needs. I’ve tried to give myself as a crutch for her to use to get back up on her feet. Told her how precious life is, how there will be infinitely many paths around any obstacle she encounters, and the fact that she having the ability to choose to stress about her problems automatically makes her bigger than these problems, etc. However, her inability to find meaning in life still gets worse with each day. Tonight was extra bad.

I’m fearful. I can’t imagine a world without her. This pattern keeps recurring and I’m scared one day she is going to let herself go. Is there anything I could do to alleviate her suffering and stress, or change her mindset about life in general? Any helpful words, actions, etc that work from experience? Thank you so much.

I really appreciate everyone who has read up till now. Whether or not you choose to leave a comment, I’m just thankful I get to relieve some of my own worries here."
310,"Me 36f him 40m

So we were good friends for a year then accidentally kissed on new year and been together since, although with a couple of blips....
First one was me not used to having him round all the time, he wasn't working at this point and would often want to stay over when I was working an early the next morning and I got a little claustrophobic and pulled back,but we sorted things out

We both suffer with our mental health to a certain degree so our second blip came around my birthday... He was going through a rough patch and had crashed out (slept for days) but we had plans to go for a drink on my bday. I hadn't heard from him in a couple of days but still thought I might get a text or call.... But nothing, I spent my entire birthday crying... What hurt is that because he wasn't answering my texts I was getting worried and asked a mutual friend to check on him and he managed to message him just fine.... On top of that he knows I hate my birthday because of childhood trauma and this was the first year I had agreed to do anything with anyone, so yeah, I was pissed off.

Since then he has got a job and we were only really seeing each other weekends and a couple of days through the week sometimes. We would always make an effort to go out, meet friends, show up to birthday drinks for them etc

Then my daughter moved in (13), which he was aware would happen from before we got together. He shows up every week to drive her to gymnastics and will help her with homework if I'm working late.... But other than that it's hit and miss

She was going to her dad's one weekend and I had cleared some time for me and him to spend together, but he ""crashed"" again.... A few times we have made similar plans and he always seems to ""crash"".... Last weekend we were going to go shopping at Disney store with my daughter and go out for dinner all together..... But he went ghost from the Thursday evening to the Monday meaning he missed the whole weekend because he crashed again.....

There is a massive part of me that thinks that it isn't really a crash and that he is avoiding me in some way, am I crazy?

I'm meant to meet his parents next weekend (which is huge for me because of previously mentioned childhood trauma), and I've been mentally preparing myself for it for months. But I am skeptical it will happen, he might crash again?

Also I asked him 2 months ago to book a day off work next week so we could spend some quality time together, I'm still not sure he has done it!

He wants me and my daughter to move in with him next year when he gets his own place (currently living with parents until divorce is finalised)..... But his actions tell me he no longer cares even though when I do see him he talks about our future and a family together etc

Is this truly one of those times that actions speak louder than words and I should walk away?

I've been so patient with his mental health as he has with mine but I just feel like it's not a relationship anymore

Also worried about losing the friendship we had before

Sorry its long..... Please help!"
311,Me[23F] and my boyfriend [45M] have been in a relationship for 6 months now. We met through work . We work in the same place. A nursing home. I’m a healthcare assistant he’s a cleaner. We do not live together we have our own apartments .. I truly believe I’ve never felt this way for anyone before and that I love him. But outside of work him and his 2 sister take care of his elderly mother who is quite dependent on them. They take turns. But he’s there most days when he’s off and evening up until late at night. I have not met his mother but I’ve met one of his sisters and his two sons.. I barely get to see him atall. The sisters boss him around and tell him when he can and can’t be there . Or when he can have a night to himself. Now his mother is in hospital and he will be there every day after work without fail all day all evening.. I won’t get to see him atall apart from in work.. I understand family comes first but am I being selfish in wanting to get some little bit of time with him? I got to spend 1 hour with him yesterday after work before he had to go over to his mothers. How do I approach a sensitive situation like this ?
312,"Hey guys. I really need your advice here. 

I (F23) have been dating someone(M23) for about 6 months now, seems like a solid, great guy overall. And he's pretty much everything I have been looking for! Great job, good values, very handsome, doesn't argue over small things, very supportive and accepting. Our sex life is great too. We see each other every weekend because we work through the week. We have said we love each other. I can't imagine not having him in my life, nor do I want to lose him. 

But for some reason I can't put my finger on.... I feel like something is missing from the relationship.

Sometimes I dread spending more than one night with him, I dread the idea of moving in with someone, I'm not sure why but I like being alone a lot of the times. We're going on vacation soon for 5 days and I should be excited but I'm dreading having to share the same space with someone else for 5 days in a row. I haven't introduced him to my family yet because I am afraid if I can't shake this feeling, then it won't work out. 

Is it me? Why do I feel like this? I should be eager and excited to spend every minute with someone I love but for some reason I'm not. I wish I could shake this feeling. Any advice would be great!"
313,"So I asked this girl out yesterday and she basically was like ima have to check my schedule, I’m in a weird place with relationships etc. so basically no but without hurting my feelings.

Anyway so that night we had a band performance (we both in band) and she didn’t even say hi to me once, we usually talk a good amount, at least once for 15-20 mins at these things. So I was already kinda depressed but it got worse this morning. So usually we talk while waiting outside the band room, we did just yesterday, but now today I didn’t even see her and when she walked past me she just pulled out her phone basically signaling that she didn’t want to talk to me.

Wtf should I do, I’m in a very bad place rn and I feel like I lost a possible gf and also a friend."
314,"Okay heads up I know I'm the TA in this situation but it wasn't deliberate or malicious, it was accidental and stupid. I'm hoping I can get some objective advice about the best ways to make it up to her and repair the situation.

My female friend can be a little possessive of me, no red flags, but she's had a hard few years and I at times may have been her only support. I've perceived that she has been anxious since I've got together with my new gf that she will lose me as a friend. I have been as supporting and reassuring that nothing in our friendship has changed, I'm never going to abandon her.

When we last met up she said something to which I guessed she is pregnant. It's still early days and her husband doesn't want anyone outside of parents to know. She said don't tell anyone. I asked, you don't want my gf to know? She said no. Fair enough. Tbh I'm not comfortable about keeping secrets from my gf as we talk about pretty much everything so keeping quiet about something is a little tricky for me as I had to make an extra conscious effort to suppress even alluding to the news. Well as you guessed I did a bad job of that.

I wanted some advice from my gf about what we can do to ensure my pregnant friend has more of a support network. During the conversation I was explaining to my gf why I wanted to her help her, why I felt she needed extra support and to avoid accidentally slipping up and casually mentioning the pregnancy I stopped myself by saying 'oh and there's some other news I can't talk about'. Yes I know that was a mistake, I knew it pretty much after the words slipped out of my mouth. My gf instantly guessed she was pregnant. I didn't want to lie to my gf so I admitted she guessed correctly. I felt pretty horrible straight away (but this ain't about me).

I decided to not mention this to my pregnant friend but if it came up I'd let her know my gf knows, not by me directly telling her but by her guessing. Well my pregnant friend did ask if I told me gf and I said no I didn't, but my gf has guessed it. It was my fault she was able to guess and I couldn't be more sorry. To this (and probably to you) this translated as I did break my promise and I did tell her.

We're still on speaking terms and I doubt my friend will break off our friendship over this however she is very upset (understandably), worried more people might find out and just worried generally. I could have lied to my gf but when the news came out it would have been obvious I was lying (not great for our relationship), equally I could have lied to my friend (which I didn't want to do as that would have been a further betrayal).

Question is what can I do, and what shouldn't I do now? I'm giving my friend space, after I let her know that I know I screwed up and failed her, but whatever support she wants I am here for her without question."
315,"My ex \[20F\] and I \[20M\] broke up a few months ago. I broke up with her because of some personal issues that affected how invested in the relationship I was.

Anyway, since then I've been out with mates and stuff like that and they all of course encourage me to rebound and 'be single' but every time I do it's just not as good. I've hooked up with girls that you could say are objectively better looking than my ex, but it was nowhere near at satisfying. Most of the time it was fun in the moment and then afterwards I just felt nothing and one time I actually felt a bit gross about it. I hooked up with a girl friend after a night out (which was maybe a mistake?) and now all I can think about is how I don't want to do that again, yet I would hook up with my ex in a heartbeat.

Is this just a matter of giving it more time? Does someone have any other good advice to deal with the fact that I still love her other than hooking up with other people?"
316,"We're in our early 20s (f20 and m22) and been going out for 7 months and are now living together. I didn't think it was too soon to say and actually thought it was weird we haven't said it so after a night out I told him. He has said he loved me to bits when he was very drunk before but I know that doesn't count cos he was drunk. Idk what to do I cried after he said he wasn't there yet and that he had never actually loved anyone, he's been in 2 previous relationships. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't love me. I'm also very embarrassed and hungover as I write this. I really thought he did love me like he does some really sweet things and the way he looks at me sometimes just makes it seem like that. Idk if he's incapable of love or incapable of loving me. His exact words are that I'm not there yet and I was like well I don't think you ever will be. Idk what to do I feel like absolute shite"
317,"(f/15) still feel comfortable around him, but he just never has anything to talk about and neither do i. when we’re in a group, however, the conversation is fine. 

i’m worried about this because i planned to hang out with him this sunday and i just don’t want it to eventually feel awkward. i know that i like him, but honestly sometimes i can feel that attraction fade when he just doesn’t really talk. 

what do i do?"
318,"My relationship is many years deep. Because of disabilities and other things, I didn't drive for all of that time. I recently got the okay and approved to drive and got a car. My bf is telling me I need to tell him everytime i leave the house and every time I get to my destination. Even if its 5 mins down the street. He claims its for my safety but its been months now and he still expects me to text him whenever I leave the house, tell him were im going and then text when I get there, text when I'm about to drive home and then text when I get home. I never had a guy act like that in a relationship. I feel like I should be able to go get a coffee or run to the store for eggs or go to the park with my dog or go to work. Without having to tell him my every move. Like obviously at the end of the day when we finally meet up and talk im gonna say everything I did that day. Its not like I wanna go do something I shouldn't. Is this him not trusting me? Are other guys like this to there girls? When do I put my foot down and just say he needs to chill? He is saying its just because he wants to know im safe but I've never gotten into an accident and if anything happens, i call him. We live together but he works full-time and I work part-time so I kind of have more free time but I don't expect him to text me all the time like that. Is this controlling or normal? I need answers lol. Would it be wrong for me to say hey I'm not gonna text and call all the time like that, but if something happens I will tell you? I mean that's what I expect from him. Anyone else experience something like this?"
319,"Hi everyone!
I’m F, 19 and my bf is M, 20. We have been in relationship for the past four months. He used to have a lot of friends but they’re just not friends anymore. He used to have his best friends and so many close friends but his friend circle is just decreasing now it’s just him, me and his few “just friends”. It feels like I am his world and it sucks sometimes when I want some space and some “me time”. According to him, his friends are selfish, never there for him, not understanding of whatever he’s going thru etc. I feel bad for going out w my girls since he doesn’t have anywhere to go. So I was wondering if it’s his friends who are bad or is it him who’s at fault?"
320,"So me (24) and my gf (f22) has sex for the first time since we was dating last night and my penis was bruised after, it’s hindering us from having sex because my penis hurts, this has never happened before and I haven’t been sexually active for 3-4 years. Is it a lube issue? Std? I’m not sure just wanted to ask around I will be going to the doctor about it."
321,"So this is something I’ve needed help on for a while and is sadly not something I’m able to talk to my friends or family about... so I’ve been dating this girl for 2 years and almost everything is great, we laugh together get shit done together are engaged in each others life and share many ah fun things in our life. Now the problem is with our sex life, she isn’t into sex for a lot of reasons. Reasons that I can’t understand cause they don’t apply to me. She was raped when she was 13 (we are 23 now)
Something I can only kinda imagine and something I can never understand. She also has one of the many female problems of sex being uncomfortable. 
let me take a step back, when we were first started dating for about the first 8 months we had sex all the time but even then even when she’s was offering it non stop I could see there was something not right she always looked like she was enduring it or waiting for me to finish. She just wanted it to be over. months after that the sex slowed down and she came out to me about the discomfort and what happened when she was younger. (We maybe have sex once a month now)
Since then it’s been a very weird experience in bed, we almost never have sex and when we do it’s obvious she’s just doing it to make me happy. The lack of sex has caused me to do what most sex craved men do in a relationship (no not cheat) I poke and ask when make stupid little jesters and signals basically saying I want to have sex again. (Which the pressure of that just makes it worse) Part of that is selfish I know but more than anything I want her to want it I feel it’s very important in a relationship to be sexually into each other. I know for some woman even some men sex is more of an obstacle than a freedom and all I want is for her to be comfortable sexually cause it’s important not only to the relationship but personally too and I’m scared this will continue to drive us apart and for future sake drive her away from other relationships and self pleasure. Which she has only masturbated twice when she was younger and hates it. Now I’ve ask about seeing a gynecologist about the discomfort and a therapist or something about the childhood trauma. She really doesn’t want to see a therapist she would love to see a gynecologist and hopefully that will happen soon with her new insurance but I wanted to ask you guys and girls what you think of this like I said were great on all accounts but that...  I just want to help if I can and at the same time sadly relinquish some of my own sexually withdraws. Problems are coming up and god I hate it and I hate my dick but I’m human and I and her can’t and shouldn’t live like this idk lemme know what you think anything is something"
322,"So I’m 20 and my boyfriend is also 20(the same one I’ve ranted about before....)and I’m so insecure because my boyfriend is handsome and I love him very much been together for two years,and he follows Ariana grande almost all the kardashians Madison beer(who I don’t like very much because he absolutely ADORES her.....)and it’s all bringing me super down and making me way more insecure than I already am....I always wish I was as beautiful as Madison because he’s had her as his wallpaper before but not for a while...he doesn’t want me as his wallpaper and hasn’t put me since we started dating....and that upsets me but anyway he used to talk about Madison and blah blah other artists before but not recently..and it just brings me down..and when I try not to think about it and ignore my insecurities it all comes back to me and makes me cry because they are all so beautiful and he(used to)talks about Madison as if he were dating HER! And just thinking about her and these other artists just being back my insecurities...it’s been bugging me for a while now and giving me so much anxiety...I’m so sad and I don’t know what I should do...I guess what I’m trying to say is that I feel like I’m not pretty enough or “curvy” enough or similar to the female artists he likes and followed on social media I feel like he’ll leave me for someone who is....I’m just a super sensitive over thinking girl because of the last and just...I’m crying right not talking all of this because I don’t know how to explain how I feel in a good way where people won’t mis interpret it all....I’m sorry guys I’m trying to explain it as best as I can haha but yeah...this is what I felt like getting off my chest for tonight haha I hope it makes sense and thank you for reading my rant!♥️"
323,"I know the title sounds like it should be on r/niceguys but please hear me out before passing judgment.

so me and my best friend have been hanging out a lot recently and constantly get into sexual situations. well its happened again last night and we got to talking, and she told me she's interested in me in every way except for romantically.  we talk every single day and hang out at least once a week. so Reddit is there any chance on there being an actual relationship, or should i just stop trying to persuing one before i fuck up the friendship?"
324,"It’s in the title. We’re both 18, she’s been renting a room in my house for about 2 months now, and I’m starting to really like her. I’m going insane just based on her response to my offer of watching a movie this Saturday. 

She had told me before that she hasn’t seen (insert movie) and when I searched Redbox, ones in my area have the movie, so I offered to rent it and then we could watch it on Saturday night.

When I texted her to ask her, she just said 
“YOU’RE KIDDING” 

and I replied

“Uhh, no I’m not kidding 😂”

“Sure, I’d be down”

It’s worth noting that I have 3 younger siblings, and that my younger brother (14) tends to stay up as late as I do. I’m hoping that he doesn’t decide to come watch the movie.

I said “So uh, are you okay with the fact that I’m planning for just the two of us?”

She just replied with “Lol yeah sure” 


I’m driving myself insane trying to tell if she actually minds it or not, and I’m not sure if she likes me very much or if she just wants to watch the movie.

To be clear, I haven’t expressly told her how I feel, and I’m not very good at reading people, but especially her.

Any advice? I just want another opinion to read the situation and give input? Maybe? Please?

EDIT: 
I’m a doofus, and I didn’t think to include the fact that I’ve known this girl for about 4 years now, she was “a friend of a friend” to me until recently, but she has always been on my family’s good side. She only recently moved back into my town in August."
325,"I don’t even know what to say. I’m four years older than my brother and, as a child, I felt like we had a typical older/younger sibling relationship. I could often be bossy and demanding, and I could get frustrated and snap at him at times. Besides this, I know that I have a tendency to be a know-it-all and pretentious, and sometimes I would get in heated discussions with my brother where I would essentially just completely shoot down his opinion and aggressively insist that I’m right and he’s wrong. These are all things that I improved on in my late teens/adult years. 

For the past several years, our relationship has been great (or so I thought). We banter, we joke around, we’re kind and supportive to each other, I invite him to things, etc. 

My brother’s been dealing with very severe depression for a while - and it’s recently gotten to the point where he’s become very close to suicide (he’s currently in an inpatient facility). Apparently, he’s told his therapists that one of the reasons he’s so depressed is his relationship with me as a child - when we would have fights with our friends/cousins, I would never take his side and sometimes, I wouldn’t let him hang out when I was with friends, and there were times where I would purposely provoke/annoy him which would make him lash out, and then I would get upset with him for lashing out/say that he had anger issues. He says he feels completely rejected by me, that I never wanted to be around him, and that he can’t trust women now.  

He also said to the psychologist that nothing I will ever do will get rid of all of the anger he feels towards me and that he can never be friends with me.

I feel so incredibly scared and guilty and so so so sad. I never ever meant to hurt his feelings, but I know I have terribly. I know there were times where I would be mean/snippy with him or where I would get aggressive about my opinions to the point of shooting down his (along with the other things he said). I just never realized how badly it may have affected him. What should I do? I want to fix the relationship, but I don’t know how/if I should."

We’ve been dating for about 6 months now and she happens to be very very insecure about herself. It is to the point where she refuses to take pictures when we are out. Sometimes she agrees to take pictures and selfies but then forces me to delete them because it’s “ugly.” She even refuses to send me selfies over Snapchat or texting. In 6 months of dating and tons of trips we have very little pictures together. I want to help her get more confident but I’m not sure what to do. I compliment her all the time and make sure to avoid any insecurities, but she doesn’t seem affected by it at all and continues to act super insecure. She often goes on huge rants out of nowhere calling herself ugly and pointing out various insecurities for absolute reason. I have talked to her about how I felt about it many times but nothing has changed. She does not have any traumatic experiences in the past either. What should I do?"
327,"I started dating my current girlfriend about 2 years ago. We met through friends and I honestly consider her one of the best things that has ever happened in my life. 

About a month after we started dating, I let her know that I had experienced some abuse as a child. She was incredibly understanding and told me that she would never pressure me to tell her anything, and that I could come to her if I ever felt ready.

About 2 months ago, I woke up one morning and for some reason I just felt like the time was right. I went to her house and we had lunch and then I explained to her that I was ready to tell her. She hugged and kissed me and told me that she was here to listen to whatever I had to say.

I basically told her that I was sexually abused by a babysitter/neighbour of mine from about the ages of 6-10. It really ruined my life in many aspects, and I had only ever told a therapist about it in the past. She hugged me and kissed me again and told me I was very brave to tell her, that she couldn't even imagine what I went through, and that she still loved me.

The rest of the day she was very quiet and distant. At the time I figured she was just trying to process what I had told her because it's a lot for someone to hear, so I let her have some time, and I thought she would eventually return to normal.

Well, fast forward two months and things haven't changed. 

Before she would be very chatty and talkative, but now I can barely manage to get more than a few sentence out of her when we see each other. She used to text me goodnight and good morning every single day and hasn't done it since I told her. In fact, she rarely texts me at all. We had a pretty healthy sex life (usually 4-5 times a week) but since I told her, we've had sex only once, and it was basically only like one level above total starfish sex from her (also, I know sex isn't the main part of a relationship, but the change is quite strange).

I've asked her multiple times if there is something wrong or if she'd like to talk but she always brushes me off. I even straight up confronted her once and asked her if she was acting strangely because of what I told her, and she snapped at me and told me I was being silly.

I feel really dirty and unwanted since this has happened. I thought telling her would be a good thing, but it seems that it's basically all but ended her love for me. I have no idea what to do.

Does anyone have any advice? I'll take literally anything at this point."
328,"My best friends family are pretty strict, they’re asian and in their culture women have certain restrictions on them.

She works and is educated but when it comes to her going out with friends she has to beg them for permission and then she is allowed out, they are constantly worried about her dating or finding a boyfriend...even though they are happy with her to have a love marriage. (Doesn’t make sense) 

Her family also hate me because of how much time me and her friend hang out, they think she should spend that time hanging out with family.

——————————THE EMAIL—————————
Monday morning I randomly checked my email which I never do, and there is one titled “URGENT” from my best friend. I open it up and it says “my sister has taken all my devices including my phone, don’t respond to this email. My sister is going to message you pretending to be me, play alone. Btw I told her I dated that creepy guy from work”.

I don’t know why she told them she dated someone who she hasn’t dated but I’m sure she has her reason to say it, maybe they found details on her dating someone and so she said the only asian guy she knew to lessen the blow. 

I haven’t received a text from her sister, I went onto my friends reddit account and all her posts about wanting to leave home are deleted.

——————————What do I do?—————————
Part of me want to go and message her, it’s been 3 days of no contact, no emails. I want to send her a message but I know she has deleted our chat log, so I can’t make it seem like I message often. 

She is looking for a new job so I could forward her a suitable role from my work as a “oh I saw this and thought of you”.

But what if the sister hasn’t messaged me yet because my notification hasn’t come up, and me messaging would give her a prompt reason to start messaging me pretending to be my best friend. I would know instantly if it was my friend talking or not, but it might just cause a new level or stress.

I’m just really worried about her and don’t know what to do.

—————————— TL;DR ————————————
My best friends strict family have taken her phone and laptop. She emailed me telling me that her sister was going to pretend to be her to get information out of me. No one has contacted me and it’s been 3 days. Should I message my friend? Or would this just trigger her sister to start fake messaging me?"
329,"I don't think I'm a very handsome guy tbh , pretty average in terms of face but I guess I have some rep in singing or something (supposedly). I keep noticing this one girl catching glances and looking at me for like 2-5 secs... Then when I look at her back , we lock eyes then she looks away shly... What does that mean ?

TL;DR girl looks at me , I look back , she looks away"
330,"I recently started seeing this guy - he’s amazing sexually buuuut - I have no sex drive anymore. Sex more than once a week hurts me. I am so tired that I struggle to stay awake the next day. 
Even though we use protection, I’m sick to death of pumping my body full of hormones. I don’t want to take contraception anymore. I don’t want to risk pregnancy, either. 

In all honesty, I’d quite happily never have sex with anyone again in my life. 

How do I end this? I keep cancelling with him all the time, using lies and excuses. Truthfully, I just can’t bear to get naked again. I don’t have the energy to engage with him. I’d rather just sleep. 

I’m 24, but I’m beginning to feel like I may be asexual. Sex feels like too much work, even in a relationship. 

I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I don’t really want to lose him as a friend - I just don’t want the “benefits” that feel more like chores. Thanks in advance."
331,"He and I have been together for about a year now, and I always want to help my boyfriend through his own tough times. He saved me from an abusive household, while he himself, also came from one. He always claims that he's long past the trauma and depressing gloom of it all. 

Though, recently, he's started to become more detached, due to newly found stress, wanting to open up to me about it. When I try to give options, recommendations, comfort, he seems to view me the same way he viewed his mother for a while, not wanting to trust or tell me anything in fear that I may turn on him. Is there any advice I can receive in order to send a message that not all women close to him will be backstabbers?

(I understand waiting it out is going to be the top answer, but please understand that it's only gotten severely worse as time goes on. I don't want to lose this relationship, and will do anything to prove to him that he's safe.) 

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
332,"We've known each other for 12 years and everything has been fine except for the last 2 months. New girl came into our circle who he was smitten by but she basically moved on me the day we met. I didn't want things to get awkward so I didn't say anything and lied to him to keep coming around even after he got rejected in case she reciprocated while still seeing her. He found out a few days ago and went no contact with me, and my friend group is pretty unanimously calling me a bitch for this. The day he found out and blew up at me I even asked if leaving the girl would make things right and he said it wouldn't undo the betrayal and how I ""manipulated"" him. Idk what to do. I want him back even if it means I have to let this girl go but hes not having it.

Tl;Dr I dated my best friends crush while making him think he still had a shot so he wouldn't cut me off."
333,After a night of partying my friend and I went back to his place to chill because we always do. One thing lead to another and we went all the way although that was not my intention. We talked later and he said he doesn’t want a FWB situation because that could get messy but also said that we might have to have this conversation again Implying that it might happen again? Feeling confused since I know he’s not the type to sleep around. He has also been pretty flirtatious for the past year..
334,I've been talking to this girl recently online and we've vibed alot make each other laugh and stuff like that. She just revealed that she's trans and I don't know what to think due to shock. How would you react and what would you do?
335,"Of course, circumstances range from person to person. 

But would love to hear stories be it personal or not. You can probably guess why...

We're in our 30's (if that matters)."
336,"First of all i want to apologise for my english, it isn't my first language.

I (F/17) don't know if this is the right subreddit to post it and im sorry if it isn't. But i don't know what to do.
I do have the asperger syndrome and go to a special needs school. We also have a guy that has early childhood autism. He always tells me that he wants to fuck me hard, that he wants to grab my ass and stuff like that. I repeatedly told him that i feel uncomfortable when he says stuff like that, he has also seen me cry about it. He always laughed about it and didn't took me seriously. Today he said it in front of a teacher. I had a total breakdown. But our teacher doesn't seem to care. She simply told me that he doesn't know what he is doing. I want to change school but it isn't possible for me. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been raped when i was 14 so im hypersensitive to this topic."
337,So basically me (14m)  and my now girlfriend who I asked out like a few days ago (F14)  want to go see a movie together but we live like 2 hours away from each other by car and 3 hours by train.  IDK if there is any real advice for this but should I go to her?  Maybe for like a Halloween thing idk
338,"I’m going to call him C. So my best friend from years ago, invited me to go to church with her. I was like fifteen. 

The then, youth pastor (c), would text me from time to time to check in. I never thought anything of it until my best friend said he never texted her. Other people commented that I was special but I ignored them. 

Fast forward, to when I’m 20, I get out of a two year relationship and I’m emotionally destroyed. And I think C texted me out of the blue. I confided in him and he was a great support system for a while. He told me he always knew I was special.

However, somewhere in that time, our texting became daily. He would tell him he loved me and he was proud of me. And I thought he was just being nice. But it turns out I was wrong. He asked me to add him on Snapchat and I knew he had other former students on it so I didn’t think much. 

What he said that was so bad: 

1. He started to tell me how his wife wasn’t fulfilling him sexually. About how she never touched him. I kinda just ignored it but said they should get a therapist. 

2. He emotionally unloaded on me. 

3. He asked for pictures of me on vacation (in a bikini). He commented on my body. 

4. And he asked me why I get flattered when girls express interest but I’m irritated when guys do. He said,”Is it like a fetish of yours?” I remember being so pissed off and said no it’s a fucking preference. 

5. “Hurry up and read the snap. I don’t want my kids seeing it.”

At this point, you’re thinking wtf is wrong with you, right? Well, when these things happened, I tried to create some kind of boundaries but I was scared he would tell some secrets I shared with him. Secrets that would would ruin my career and my family. So I felt that I couldn’t stop contact completely. 

As if that wasn’t enough, I ran into him at a wedding and he texted me and asked me to meet him so we could “really talk”. I agreed before he told me the location and he had me go into a back closet of the church. 

As soon as I approached him, it felt like I was being suffocated. There was a vibe that hadn’t been there before. He kept asking me if I was okay and I just wanted it to be over. So I lied and said yes. He hugged me and I felt his hands go lower and lower. I held my breath and thought,”Oh my god. He’s going to rape me. I put myself into this position. No one is going to hear me.” He asked me a few more times if I was okay and I said yes. I had to get away from him. And he wouldn’t have let me if I said no. Or worse, he would have made me talk about it. 

***he didn’t rape me or touch me but his hands were very close to my ass.

After that, I was traumatized and I told him not to contact me on snapchat anymore. I blocked him and only wanted to text from now on so I had proof of anything he said. Fast forward a few months, he shows up at my job!!!!! I freak out and send a long text about how I can’t be his friend anymore and if his wife and kids knew all the things he said, he wouldn’t have them in his life. So I was cutting contact. 

But I’m still pissed about everything and I have some suggestive text messages that are evidence. So do I tell him wife? Do I confront him? Do I tell the people in charge of his church? I’m scared he’ll use what he has against me. 

Edit: grammar

TDRL: My (23F) youth pastor (M48)  took advantage of me in a vulnerable time. And now that I have proof of what he’s said, I don’t know what to do with the information."
339,"Hey everyone. There’s a girl who just came to our school this year. She is in band with me, and in my English class. I’ve developed a bit of a crush on her, and I want to start talking to her. She’s quiet but not antisocial, and I’m reasonably confident she knows my name. We walk the same way after English, so I plan to start talking to her as we walk. Anyone have any advice on this? I want to become friends first for at least a year before I make a move. I can’t drive and stuff so dating would be difficult, and after all I just met her. I don’t want to seem creepy or like I’m flirting, so I’m a bit cautious. Any advice on what to say?"
340,"A bit of back story, but we've been together 8 years as of this April, but have dated a little as teens and known each other on and off since then. Neither of us really are interested in marriage, but we are pretty close and speak about long term, and being together, no doubt. You just know. I want to deepen our relationship, I've read in lots of articles that couples who experience new things bond more.
 
He's so good to me and I just want to return and show more love. It's just hard when you're both pretty broke and there's some limitations."
341,"I never thought I would use this subreddit but here I am...
Anyways me and my bf have been dating for a year and 3 months we are LDR but for the past few weeks he has been barely communicating with me and choosing to play video games with his friends over me A LOT. Whenever he played in the beginning of our relationship it wasn’t an issue at all cause he still made time to talk to me but now he barely talks to me and he texts back hours later after I texted. I just feel like he isn’t into our relationship anymore but yet he still says he loves me and how much I mean to him and how he misses me. I just want him to be honest with me or at least end the relationship if he doesn’t want to be with me. I’ve talked to him how it bothers me that he doesn’t tell me that he’s going to be busy or that he’s going to play for hours. I’ve been cheated on and used by guys before and my bf has been the only who has made me feel special and actually talks to me about issues.  

I’m sorry if this is all over the place I just feel hurt and all over the place 

Advice?

EDIT: I don’t want to break up with him I just want a way to fix it"
342,"So, idk how I should start this but okay.
I [f18] have been going strong with my current boyfriend [m19] for over 6 months now and I want to grow up with that beautiful human being.
But my issue here is that I can’t get my mind off that he deserves someone better then me. I assume it is because low self esteem but I don’t have a clue. 

I get sad and feel rejected when he are with girls and don’t tell me beforehand and I feel like a fucking psycho when I do that so I ignore him during those times so he don’t get worried. I have brought it up that I feel this way and he tells me that he will stop meeting them just to make me feel secure but I hate that. I don’t want to limit him just because I got problems. 

Today a saw a picture of one of his girl friends he have traveled with and my first thought was “why doesn’t he want to be with her? Why is he with me?”. And it breaks my heart every time I think such things because I know he loves me deeply but my mind can’t get it stuck. 
And when I think like that I take some space from him and get interested in other guys, I don’t flirt or take things far I just have friendly manners with them and I get attached??? I hate myself and my feelings and I don’t know what to do. I just want to be with him but at the same time I feel like I am holding him hostage even if he assures me every time that isn’t the case.
What should I do?"
343,"We’ve been friends since we were 13, we are both 21 now. 
But lately she’s just been getting on my nerves, we’re both single and we’re just having fun in our youth with some temporary partners. 
One night stands, booty calls, whatever you want to call it. 
I don’t really speak on my booty calls cause well who the hell cares, it was one night with someone I don’t really care about, vice versa. 
But she just does not shut up! And bases her whole priorities and plans around boys, for example the other weekend we went out because apparently someone she wanted to hook up with was going to be there, I was sore and sick from work but she can make you feel so bad so to save the sooky stories the next day I just went. 
And he didn’t even turn up, I was mad and she was pissed that I was mad. 

Another example, she always has to state that she might be pregnant, when I tell her well obviously use the contraception or plan b, she just laughs and acts all immature. 
Like yes I’ve been in this situation also and she just dismisses it. 
I don’t want to entertain it anymore because I feel like she just likes the attention, and when I just say her options like a adult rather then being all like “omggggg” she assumes I’m being judgmental or I don’t care 

I’m just so tired of acting excited to hear her stories over and over again, it makes her sound conceited and she thinks she’s some type of special because she sleeps with so many men. 
It’s just boring to me now, I honestly don’t have the energy for it and sometimes I feel rude because when she starts talking about herself I’ll just go on my phone or something because I can do anymore more fake “oh my god”s anymore. 


How do I get her to just shut up or just power down cause I can not deal with it anymore."
344, I was looking down at my phone scrolling on reddit. Walking to home room. And then I pass this person standing and I just had I fucking had to turn around. I had no idea who it was but I still turned around. And I recognized the book bag. And the hoodie and the hair. It was him. My sexting friend. But this wouldn’t be a good thing if he was my sexting friend. I quickly looked forward. A rush of excitement went through my body. And my legs felt weak I legit was about to fall. But I maintained my posture. I started leaking faster up the stair well and I immediately started smiling. My legs felt so weak I wobbled. Why did he have this effect on me?
345,"Hello there.

---

TL;DR fell in love with this girl, now we are conversing through texting. Can't find a good topic to drive the convo deeper

---

So I (28 M) met this girl (31 F) on a 7 day tour and we've been hitting it off ever since. Since the trip is over we both returned to our hometown and started texting. I still find it hard to get past the small talks and jokes with her. And I don't know when should I be more forward that I like her.

Can anyone help coach me on how should I move forward?

Thank you"
346,"I know games are like heroine for young men these days. They will just stay playing on the computer for hours. I get so frustrated because he wasn't like that few months ago. We've been dating for a year and the last 2 months are really rough because we argue about the same thing and no improvement for him to play games less for me. I have talked to him about the concern I have, but I have no idea what ways that I can actually make him play less. We are in a long distance relationship because of uni and we see each other every 2 weeks and I sort of expect a decent way of communication during the times we are apart. 

Please give me advices with hopefully becoming a solution for me. Thanks :D"
347,"My gf 14 has been my crush for awhile but after I asked her out we don’t talk a lot she acts like she’s embarrassed around me. What do I say.  

Also how can I show my affection for her"
348,"Well, it's actually more of a rant and an attempt to understand what's going on and my possible solutions. The post will be quite long, so my apologies for this.

The problem with me arises when her sex drive gets lower and we have sex like once a month. I can cope with it in physical way: spend time with her, cuddle, kiss, play games, not mentioning sex at all. But the further it goes into the month, the more my depression grows on my insecurities. The thing is she's my first gf and before her I had aweful expirience with women. I am 5'5 inches tall and I always used to make fun out of it, but eventually it became a complex after like 10th girl I was becoming close with rejected me for the same reason as everyone else.

I always ridiculed this reason and thought there must be another reason I always get rejected. My personality might be nasty at times, especially last years, thus I always tried to listen carefully to what my crush has to say. More then that, my first crushes in highschool started with girls who payed extra attention to me and I tried being considerate, eventually overhyping myself and falling for them to learn they don't see me this way (srsly girls, if you want to be a bro, don't hug and cuddle all the time, I don't do this shit with my male broes, you are really hard to be read). I'm good friends with some of these girls now, as they genuinly like my humour and personality, as they say. Also they're fine spending time with me, just not in this way.

Thus I thought about my looks. Through my university years I've changed my hearcut, grow beard, changed clothing style. I expirience no problem getting likes on my photoes in tinder. I do sports, have somewhat athletic build. Not bumped up, but fir overwhole. The problem arises when they read my height in my profile. One didn't even say hi to me in reply, but straight forward offended me with ""you are too small to text me, why are you even trying"". In university I continued getting rejected. It's not like I was building a friendzone everytime. Few times I started with straightforward dating. One of them was so into me after comunicating online, she gave me a chance and we went on dates for a few month. But then she dumbed me for her long-lasting crush who is higher then me and she has more physical attraction towards him. From her own words, I'm not making this up despite not believing it myself.

Despite my insecurities I try acting confident. Took some basic acting lessons in university years and also taking confidence from martial arts. If I'm not scared of a man 2 heads higher then me, why should I be afraid of some tiny girl saying me some hurting words? Aslo served in the army for the whole year. However, I can be very emotional. Like girly level of emotional. It mostly appers in possitive feelings, like love and affection, as I hold neggative ones inside. I know you should cry if you really want to, but I forbid myself doing so in my school years after seing how much does it hurt my parents seing me crying. Now it became a custom for me to hold my feelings till the last moment. Thus I belive these overflowing emotions might be the case for rejections.

And in this state I found my current gf. She's a bisexual, but I'd say she's more into girls. She can't masturbate to porn with guys, for example. I think I might be the only guy she feels atraction towards. She knew my whole story, as she was a friend for a long time and developed feelings towards me. I couldn't reject her, despite she's not my type, because I really had no other choice and wanted at least one of us to be happy. We've put a lot of effort being perfectly honest with each other about everyting, finding compromises and making common hobbies. After a year I fell for her and her devotion. I learnt to like her looks and personality. And I don't want to abondon her in any case, because I  genuinely care for her and know she depends on me.

But when we have these 1-sex-per-month moments my inner demons persuade me that she has started dating me out of misery and there is no girl alive who would find my attracive. I am most certain she loves me with her heart. Just not in sexual way. As we are honest with each other, she knows what troubles me and suggested cheating on her. We've discussed people with open relationships before and agreed jealousy leads nowhere and it's a broken concept for one to belong to somebody, and if we have spare love to share with others, why not. The world will be a better place this way. But I know this will hurt her despite these philosophical discussions. And I won't ever lie to her, this is my policy in relationships. However she thinks if I do some other girls I'll become confident of myself and solve both problems of my higher sex drive and insecurities. On the other hand, even if I forget about the cheating part, I'm most certain I won't find any girl who would want to just have sex with me. Thus I know I have no reason even trying to cheat, and I don't really have a pinpoint question to ask. But maybe someone can see what's wrong in my story and how to deal with my insecurities."
349,"So I only have one ball. My girlfriend noticed this, and now she won’t stop making jokes about it. The most common joke of hers is to call me hitler. At first I found it funny,  but I’m  starting to feel insecure about it now. How should I tell her? We have a relationship where we joke around with each other a lot."
350,"Using a throwaway kind of.

As the title says, I’m autistic. I just got together with my girlfriend, previously my close friend of four years, and she is the most wonderful, beautiful person in the world. I love her to death, I think about her all the time, and whenever I see her or she texts me I smile. 

The problem is that I’m really awful at affection, and I worry that this makes her think I don’t love her as much as I do. I show affection in rather unconventional ways; I struggle to verbalize my feelings, even saying “I love you” feels impossible, but I go out of my way to help her out or make little gifts for her. I like physical contact too, like hugging or just sitting close enough to touch knees, but I’m also terrible at initiating that. 

I don’t think she understands this though. I have a feeling her love language is much different than mine, and I’m struggling to try and bridge the gap. 

Is there a way I can get better at this? I’m still learning how to be in a relationship, this is my first. Thank you to anyone who responds!"
351," 

It's taken me quite a while to do this because on one hand I am terrified at the responses I will receive, but on the other the actual prospect of staying in this without any proper plan is also getting to me.

My boyfriend (23/M) and I (23/F) have been together on and off since we were in high school for about 9 years. It started out with me coming out of a really long relationship that was emotionally abusive and with him always having feelings fro me. He was a gentleman the whole time and did not confess his feelings for me even after I broke up with him, until I kind of asked him whether he did and that was how it started?

Fast forward through almost 2 years and I just got annoyed with the fact that he was overly emotional, immature and frankly without any drive? I felt tired from having to always carry his weight, and walk on eggshells when it came to talking to him in general. It got very frustrating and I felt like our lives were going in extremely different directions, which I felt was something permanent that could not be fixed. So when I found out he hid something from me, it was my breaking point and I chose to end it and walk away.

(Now I am in no way perfect and now as I reflect back realise, have my own flaws coming from a home of divorce while my partner has a beautiful family and a stable home. I have a tendency to bury my feelings and instead just jump onto another romantic relationship to cover the loss of my previous one. It is something that I am now working on, but is something to just keep in mind)

So fast forward to the end of 2015 and I have dated 2 other people and both relationships have ended terribly. He sweeps in again like my knight in shining armor to just help me get through the emotional turmoil and before we know it the old feelings are back again for us both. He decides to pursue a job in the Air Force while I go off to college and the past few years have been really exhausting beyond belief.

I have supported him through all of his trainings as well as his packed social schedule, having to meet all of his friends and spend adequate time with his family. I would like to qualify that I'm pretty understanding when it comes to these things even though I do not have much family or friends myself but I feel like I can no longer bear with it. We have been arguing on and off for months on end about him prioritising me whether it comes to his friends or its family and I think I may have reached my breaking point. I do not get along well with his friends because they are rather immature and have also disrespected me on various occasions which he, for the sake of staying neutral between his friends and I has not said anything about.

We started to do long distance end of last year as he had to go off for training and so he comes back every 3-4 months to see his family and I. I have recently been battling with my own demons about my parents' divorce and come to grips with my own baggage. We have gone the distance, with him trying to come back more often and with me going over as well, even though he's 12 hours apart and as a college kid it costs nearly 4 months of working for me to save up to go to him. We have been bumpy ever since May because I have been in this weird funk about committing to him since I feel like we don't have a clear plan about where this relationship is going? Honestly can't tell if its my baggage or what I feel in my heart right now. We tried to iron it out in August when he was in town and agreed on taking space apart to figure it out. In the meantime, he tells all of his close friends as well his mother about our problems, which is totally okay but put me in a really weird spot when I went to his place to follow him to send him off to the airport.

It was like everyone was treating me differently because they knew? And as much as I love him, he's really crap at multitasking and he barely spoke to me the whole time he was with his friends and family. I felt really disrespected and it brought home again the reality that I would always somehow be playing second fiddle to his friends and family. We are in the middle of a really ugly ""break"" which he insisted on us taking, where he insists we should talk face to face when he's back this month instead of on the phone. And I can't tell if I'm being sensible or my ego is upset that it is so easy for him to toss aside someone who has been by his side through all this time.

I have no idea whether I am overthinking this but I really need some advice.

Thank you for reading this far, bless you :("
352,"My (now-ex) boyfriend and I had been together for nearly eight years, living together for seven. We have two dogs together. Recently, I noticed he'd been texting a lot with a coworker (22f) and the two of them have been hanging out quite a bit. I have no problem with him having female friends, I have many platonic male friends as well and am not typically a very jealous person but I was immediately suspicious of their relationship.

She clearly has a crush on him and I told him it made me uncomfortable that they were spending so much time together. He was always defensive and insisted they were just friends but I asked him to please set some boundaries with their friendship since I couldn't shake the feeling that something was going on. He refused and kept repeating that they were ""just friends."" He was also suddenly very distant and constantly glued to/protective of his phone which were big red flags to me.

I brought this up several times over the last couple of weeks and today he finally admitted that he does have feelings for her and doesn't think our relationship is going anywhere anymore. I'm glad he was finally honest (even though he lied to my face the first few times I brought it up) but I am absolutely devastated and feel blindsided despite noticing the changes in his behavior a few weeks ago.

He agreed to move out and said that I can keep the dogs, but he wants to be able to visit them occasionally. I told him I didn't agree to that, not out of spite but because I think it will make it very difficult for me to move on if I still have to see/deal with him for dog visits. He thinks I'm being unreasonable. Am I?

Also, what are some steps I can take to heal and feel better? I'm having a really hard time."
353,"I’ve known my friend “Amy” since 2nd grade. Amy is incredibly ambitious and competitive. Her drive to get into a prestigious college caused her some health problems in high school. After college, her drive to land a job at one of her dream prestigious tech companies (and a few rejections from them) also caused her to have a depressive episode. 

A couple years ago, she finally landed a job at her dream company in a city that is far from where I live. She was so happy and finally relaxed. Earlier this year, she suddenly contracted a rare illness that caused her to lose the ability to walk. She hasn’t been able to walk normally since February. For the first 2 months, she was so dizzy and weak that she couldn’t walk at all. April and on, she could walk slowly with a walker and unsteadily and very slowly without one. It’s mostly due to her lack of balance caused by the illness. The doctors and multiple specialists say that it’ll just take time for her brain to heal. Unfortunately, not being able to walk has caused her to spiral into depression. She barely leaves the house. She’s on medical leave from work. She used to call me repeatedly crying and lamenting “why couldn’t it have been someone else who got sick” and how she “doesn’t deserve it.” She has never eaten healthy, but her depression + not leaving bed + eating frozen meals has caused her to lose a TON of weight and muscle. We used to be about the same size and now her legs are barely bigger than the size of my arms. Any advice we try to give her causes her to freak out and cry. 

She isn’t willing to go to a therapist since she says they’re all “full of shit” since they aren’t willing to tell her that she’ll heal. She doesn’t want to hear or talk about anything other than whether she’ll be ok again. 

Her parents have flown from our city down to her city to live with her now, so at least I know she is going to be eating healthier and hopefully go to physical therapy or regular therapy sessions. I hear from my parents that she isn’t improving at all. I’ve been texting her encouraging things but she hasn’t responded to me or any of our mutual friends since June. She’s now telling her parents that if she’s going to be disabled, she doesn’t want to live.

I’m at a total loss. I don’t know what to do and have never handled a situation like this before, especially since we are states away. Do you have any advice Reddit?"
354,"My girlfriend is one of the sweetest girls I’ve ever met and she is very good about showing her love to me.  But being long distance, it has made it hard for me to reciprocate when I don’t really see her. We are both in college (she’s in Arizona I’m in California). Asking especially to those experienced with long distance, does it get easier? Is it worth sticking through?"
355,"My husband and I have been together 6 years and married for 3. I haven’t been 100% happy in a while and somedays I struggle a lot. He mentions that he doesn’t know what he’d do without me, he wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for me, and I’m his best friend etc. There are things he’s done that I have a hard time forgiving and think about frequently (lying for example). With our relationship struggling, I think about what life would be like if we separated. There are many things about him that drive me insane but I won’t list them here. I’ve tried to address these with him but nothing changes. I’m not sure if he sees my frustration as of recent. 

Adding to this, I am a manager where I work and I am starting to have feelings for one of the supervisors (22M) who reports to me. We are close and have great conversations and spend time together as friends. He noticed things about me that most people don’t. I don’t KNOW if he feels the same way, but sometimes I feel it. We wouldn’t be able to see what could happen because it’s prohibited at work. EDIT: I would never pursue anything with this person because I love my job! I don’t want to be fired and I know workplace relationships are a no go. 

Husband and I just spent 2 weeks on vacation and I had a lot of thoughts about the work crush while we were gone. 

I need advice on how to approach my husband and am wondering what you’d do in this situation. Should we maybe try couples therapy? Should we take a break and see what happens? Should I just keep on keeping on? Help!

TLDR- My husband and I are struggling but I don’t know if he knows. I’m having feelings for someone who reports to me at work. What would you do?"
356,"I have a crush on this girl. We have been friends for a bit. Things were getting sexual and then I got super confused and accidentally denied all her advances out of anxiety. I truly kick myself over this, but my hesitancy came from the fact that I asked her out months ago and she said no. So her flirting after the fact was confusing to me (is she even flirting, etc). I couldn't accept that things were different now because I wasn't sure.

Like it was as bad as one day she asked me something sexual and I completely shot it down. I know. But please understand the confusion especially as a woman, it's hard to read women. Especially after they say they just like your friendship and don't want a relationship.

Months pass. Nothing happens. I give up my *behavior*, but retain my feelings. I discover she has a very clingy ex (obsessive, immature woman who makes moves on her all the time) and who is suddenly VERY interested in her after she finds out about me. The ex even has her own girlfriend/fiance (open relationship?), but makes moves on my crush, despite the fact that my crush said *no to her too*. Like it was gross to witness. Doing baby talk to her and wrapping her arms around her and stuff, they even kissed cheeks in front of me. Here's the even weirder part. It is obvious they both still have casual sex.

I like this girl so much I feel gross, it's unrequited. I've been dating other people all year because I knew she didn't want to date me, but every girl I dated, I would end up distracted by her. I thought that was some kind of sign to pursue this one girl. However, at the time I asked her months ago, she didn't want to date. So I walked away from it despite my feelings. **But apparently, by not date,** ***she meant FUCK and flirt and hang out without strings attached.*** **Which is what she's doing w/ex. ...isn't that just causal dating?**

So.

My question.

Did I fuck up? Should I have just flirted back way before then? Beat the creepy-adultery-on-her-own-fiance ex to it? I'm beating myself up, confused and sad. The ex definitely would get back together with my crush if she ever left her gf. Which it seems as though she may. Her current relationship isn't doing well.

She admitted to going to the ex in desperation. She may have tried to get *that* from me and I squandered it. If she flirted with me enough. If I didn't keep accidentally turning away or changing the subject to protect myself from heartbreak. But my heart feels broken now to be honest, not sure if I have a right to be. I feel pretty stupid and confused. Did I have a chance I ruined? Fuck"
357,"So me and my girlfriend got together I’m 8th grade and broke up with me for no reason have a 5-ish month relationship, and everything was good she just broke up with me. Her plan was to date me in highschool. Now that I’m in highschool she started liking me and me and her are dating now. Everything is good but I’m VERY boring. My friends know me as the type to make jokes and roast people and all that, but in reality I’m very boring (and sometimes annoying when I’ve know you long enough), and I don’t know what to do about it because me and the girl can have 3 hour talks and then I just get dry and I don’t want that to happen, and she doesn’t want me to hang up. So please, any advice on how to keep a relationship conversation going"
358,"Let me retype this, me and my girlfriend had plans, we've been dating for two years, and we always hang out(daily). We keep everything open to one another and always out on the table. She came in today wearing nicer clothes then usual for her, she said she had a band thing to do, ditched 3 hours with me for 20 extra minutes in band, then she proceeded to tell me she couldn't make it to the date today. Even though she knew she couldn't even before the day started. Canceled minute of"
359,"My long distance boyfriend (22M) and I (23F) have been dating for three months now, so the relationship is fairly new. I met him a month before we started dating (Edit: we met IRL through a university summer program and decided to go long distance, thought that was an important point), so altogether we've known each other four months, so we don't know each other super well. That being said, he's a great guy. I've only had a couple of other relationships and they were both terrible, this one is really different. My boyfriend is affectionate, kind, and caring, and we both care a lot about each other. He's very accountable for his actions and doesn't raise any typical red flags that I've become hyper aware of since I've been through a lot of abuse. Maybe it's important to note, his ex was extremely abusive as well. He never really talks about it but I heard through a few mutual friends.

Now, here's the thing. Every once in a while we'll get into some stupid fight because he has a weird false memory or misremembers something about me, our conversations, etc. This is my perspective so of course we have to assume he's the one who isn't remembering correctly, but if it helps he for example remembered that ""the third vertebrae in my spine is messed up"" when I was complaining about having pain while walking, even though it's actually a labral tear in my hip which I have said many times. Doesn't surprise me that he can't remember that, it surprises me that he comes up with such a specific memory of something that is not wrong with me?

There's been another few notable examples, like him thinking I was renting a house alone instead of moving into my dorm room like I said I was, him thinking we had some conversation about how I enjoy looking younger than I am (even though I actually really hate this cause it's annoying at this point getting handed the kid's menu at 23), and most recently me planning to move close to my grandparents once I graduate (when we never had this conversation). I don't think it's him talking to another woman because well, I trust him, and the false memories are close enough to real conversations/situations that I can see where he may have drawn a conclusion, but he thinks they were specific conversations that didn't happen and it just weirds me out really badly. He's also definitely not gaslighting me as these conversations would be pointless to gaslight over. He also is apologetic when I feel upset or confused and tries his best to work through the issue holding himself accountable, which is the opposite of gaslighting behavior.

His excuses so far have been that he has memory problems, and I could see not remembering something that did happen, but the false memories are what confuse me. He also remembers really specific things like the first day we met (date and day of the week), and the day we started dating, but has these weird false memories.

It might seem silly that I get worked up over these things but I just feel upset when the false memories come up as they confuse me. I think it may illicit a trauma response from past gaslighting, even though logically I can acknowledge the situations are different. I was just thinking more about it and my sister also has these weird false memory problems where she'll insist something happened that no one in the family remembers/is not possible to have happened, and my dad does the opposite (saying something hurtful he did/said never happened).

I'm working on being more compassionate through his memory issues, but does anyone have any idea why this happens? What's your take on the situation? What do you think we should do about it/is there anything you guys think can help either of us or the relationship? I really appreciate it."
360,"I (14F) joined a program for helping fellow teenage girls with moderate intellectual disability. So today I had the first session with my buddy for the activity (18F) at her school. Since the volunteers outnumbered the girls (we were in a 2:1 ratio), this was a 2 on 1 activity and I had another volunteer helping me with my buddy. She’s also 14F.

After I was grouped with her, the teachers-in-charge of the activity asked us to move our chairs in a circle. As I pushed my chair, I noticed that she seemed to be following my movements. When I stopped pushing my chair, she kept pushing hers until hers was right next to mine with no space between us. Slight teacher intervention was needed in order to arrange the chairs back into a circle. She was looking at the floor the entire time with a smile o her face, and hadn’t made eye contact with anyone in the room (none of this bothers me, just a few observations.)

After I sat down, she appeared very fascinated with the snacks I had in my lap, as I’d just so happened to select the same ones as she did. The teachers allowed us to start eating, and I tried to show her how to open each one of the snacks, and she continued to imitate all my movements, but still struggled with all of them. In the end the other volunteer opened them all for her.

She’s not very good at verbal communication. We tried speaking to her, but it was to no avail because it was like she either couldn’t hear, or she was too nervous/not sure how to respond. At one point I got up and started dancing. I began to ask her if she liked dancing, but stopped midway because the other volunteer was looking at me funny.

I stopped after a while because I thought it seemed to be putting pressure on her, but the other volunteer continued trying to ask her things. Only when the teacher would occasionally come by to give her a push would she say anything at all. However, I think she did want to communicate with us. Imitating our movements and actions was her way of communication in my opinion.

It seems like she’s in some kind of shell right now where she isn’t fully prepared to come out. I later learned that in the past she would sometimes start yelling loudly when placed in unfamiliar situations with strangers.

I feel like she’s trying her best, and I want to help her. Any suggestions on ways to communicate next time I see her?"
361,This is the first relationship i had since i got out. I had to serve 5 years for it. Its been two years since then and i have been dating my gf for 6 months. I haven't told her because im not brave enough. Is it something important to tell her?
362,"Hi people of Reddit,

Using a throwaway. I have always come to you guys for dealing with a lot of things in my life. And reddit has always been my saviour. Be it showing me a different perspective or setting me straight and giving me a reality check. 

My GF (26/F) and I have been together for almost a year. She is without a doubt the best girl I have ever met in my life. Probably the best human being! We’ve both dated and fucked around before so this is not coming from a place of lack of experience. She is beautiful, an amazing person, we are emotionally and physically super compatible, the sex is fire and all in all, that girl is just an angel. When she met me, I was in a negative head space and really anti relationships and negative but her positivity really helped me. There is no toxicity between us. We resolve conflicts together without screaming wars or being disrespectful. We just fit perfectly together. 

Now the issue is this, I applied for my permanent residency via the Express Entry Skilled Labour program for Canada before I met her. The whole process took a year and I will be getting my PR in 45-60 days. I have two engineering degrees and I work for the largest medical device company in the world. I have a good job now but I plan on moving once I get my PR and start a new life in Canada. Moving abroad and living on my own and experiencing a new country and a new work environment has always been a life goal for me. The better standard of living compared to where I’m from is a major factor. 

She has a business here and that means she cannot move and shift countries without it affecting her business. She runs a fashion label and that would mean she would have to literally shut it down because she has a huge clientele here and her brand is really doing well here. 

I’m torn between deciding to move but having to end things with her or staying back and being with her. She obviously wants me to pursue my career just like I don’t want her to move with me and literally lose her career/brand. The thing is, I feel when only one person makes a sacrifice like that, there is always resentment which pops up. Maybe not now, but in the future. Also, I feel like if we do end up together, we would both want to work because she is a hustler and really loves her work. I wouldn’t want my career to grow at the cost of her career literally burning to the ground. I mean, that would mean she’s at home all the time or something like that. 

So while I plan on moving out by January-February 2020, I’m distraught because on one hand I know that keeping this going would mean breaking up a few weeks before I have to leave and that would mean going to a new country, which already is a daunting task, uprooting your life and finding a new job, new house, building a social life, but doing this with heartbreak on your mind will be practically torturing myself. So what do we do? Break up now and give ourselves time to heal before I leave or wait it out or what. 

The thing is, I’m from a culture where girls are pretty much pressurised to get married after a certain age and if we end it now, my girlfriend’s parents will start ‘looking for someone’ for her. And there is a good chance she’ll be ‘arranged’ with someone within a year. 

Also, I’m from a well to do family but we’re not crazy rich. Her family has a net worth of around 100 million dollars. She’s independent and makes her own money. But we also don’t know whether her parents would ever be okay with her ending up with someone who is not of the same economic strata. And based on what we’ve discussed, I’ve been very honest with her that if that is a deciding factor for her parents and if their opinion on it means anything to her at all, I will happily break up because I’m 25 and highly qualified and I am doing much better than anyone else my age is. And I’m confident that this is just the start, I will obviously grow a lot more in my career. Just because I wasn’t born with an inheritance, that’s not my fault right?

So, I come to you guys, not wanting you to make the decision for me but to share your outlook about this and your different perspective might help me see things which I’m missing right now. Or if you’ve been through something similar, I can probably learn from your experiences. 

I’m just mentally exhausted trying to think about this. So is my girlfriend. And that’s ruining the present time we have together as well. 

TL;DR- I (25/M) plan on moving abroad in 3-4 months. My GF (26/F) has her business here. Her moving would mean she ends up literally quitting her business and me staying back means I’ll never get to achieve a life goal to live and work abroad."
363,"This is long, buckle in. 

I've been with my bf for 4 years, known him for 5. I love him, but I'm getting tired of feeling like the adult in the relationship. When I met him he lived with his parents, didnt have a license and no car, but I took it in stride because not everyone has supportive parents. His weren't too keen on him as he was only 2 years sober. Whatever, I was willing to help get him where he needed to be. 

Fast forward, we finally have a place of our own, and have for over a year now. During these 4 years I've been trying to get our life together. Establish a budget, get him a car, encourage him to find a better job (ive changed jobs 3 times in pursuit of better wages) and just plan for our future. Hes affectionate, we're all around happy, in love. You would think your partner who said they want to be with you and marry you would be on board with this. 

No.

Everytime I try to talk about these things or suggest a change, it turns into a fight. Sometimes it's a few quick snaps in acknowledgement but nothing else, after ignoring what I say, other times it's literally devolves into us yelling at each other because he doesnt care and I do. I pay my car payment, my half of the rent, insurance, internet, pay the electric occasionally, buy gas, and groceries twice a month. He pays the electric other times, his half of rent, groceries twice a month !nd buys gas when I'm between checks and that's it. He didnt even have his half the last 2 months (I paid the whole thing)and I've been asking him for 3 to save up so I can get car repairs. That hasn't happened.

As far as household duties go, I do all the cooking and occasionally help with dishes and other cleaning. He cleans but doesn't cook. This means I'm up at 5am making him breakfast (which i dont even eat most of the time) and making dinner before I can even relax when we get home, not to mention cooking 3 meals a day on weekends. He literally will not cook for himself even when i dont feel well. 

So at this point I'm doing all the driving, all the cooking, and making sure our bills get paid. I have depression, add, and anxiety, and the toll this takes on me is starting to become noticeable. Except he thinks I can just change my mindset, (that's a whole other story) and try different tricks to handle it better. He refuses to believe I tried anything to help, and doesnt want me on medication.

I love him, but I dont know how to get through to him and get him to be more responsible, more understanding, or to care about our future. I rack my brain for hours trying to think of how to talk to him so doesnt blow up, and Im just tired. It's even worse because he then turns around and claims I'm his soulmate and things like that. 

How do I get him to work with me to make both our lives better? I dont think I can deal with this for the rest of my life."
364,"We got together 6 months ago, around two months after she broke up with a previous (of 4 years). Things were rocky at the start with her feeling guilty about her past relationship, talking through it all the time and making daily references. We got through it and I learned to be more supportive and trusted that it was for her benefit and that she didn’t have feelings any more. Last night she saw a picture of him and cried worried that he was with somebody else and that meant their previous relationship wasn’t true or didn’t mean anything. Reacted by asking if she thought she was 100% in our relationship which just caused an argument. It’s making me feel anxious about us moving forward and am not sure what to do."
365,"Hi

I've been dating this girl for 5 months. We haven't had any sexual contact. I'm a virgin (never done oral either or anything sexual with anyone). She's done things with her one ex, yet is still a virgin. I find this makes me really uncomfortable sometimes when I think about it, so I try not to.

Recently, we were kidding around over text and then she mentioned how she saw her ex with a new girl, and said it's fine, the girl has her 'sloppy seconds', which is obviously in a negative manner

I don't even think this makes sense since she's a virgin, yet it made me think about the fact she's done things and i've pretty much saved myself for her. It really turned me off at that point and I became very anxious or upset as I also saw it as a two-way statement where i'd be recieving his sloppy seconds, in a sort of demeaning manner.

I think i'm also largely feeling this way because i've never done anything yet she has, which makes me feel not jealous or anything, moreso unfair and uncomfortable

Am I overreacting? I think I am to a certain extent. Thanks"
366,"**Back ground:** 

Last year I lost my well paying job and we tried to live off of minimum wage but wasn't getting enough hours. After struggling for the better half of a year we ended up moving in with my mom. My brother's family has always lived with my mom I guess they call it never leaving the nest? My sister in law (25F) seems to be really unstable with her emotions and I suspect there is some underlying issues. 

**Prequel:** 

I feel that adding this info is really important to what is being observed. My sister in law (25F) doesn't have a stable relationship with her parents. One parent (50ishF) used to be super neglectful of my sister in law and her siblings and would just scream and not care about what was going on. The other parent (50ishM) worked all the time and ended up divorcing and getting remarried. His new wife (50ish F) does not get along with my sister in law.  It's at the point my sister in law blames her Dad's new wife for ruining their relationship. I kinda of feel it's both ways but wasn't here for when shit went down.

**Present:** 

After having moved in with my Mom (51F) everything was going just fine. My kids picked up on behaviors of her kids and vice versa figured this is normal for kids to do. My sister in law works graveyard shift at a care facility with my wife (27F). Starting a two or so weeks after moving in my sister in law has resorted  to segregate (5M,9F) her kids from mine (3F, 1M). My sister in law wakes up to get her kids ready for school and just begins to scream at her kids about getting up and getting ready for school. While she does this she tries to get my younger brother up (22M) and tells him she is going to throw him out for not having a job and how it's her personal mission to make sure he finds work. If my younger brother tries to stand up for himself she tells him to GTFO and go to counseling and he should feel grateful that ""She allows"" him to live there.

She takes her kids to school then comes back and stands in the living room. She then snaps and has comments for everything that everyone has to say. If you tell her it's none of her business she get's even more bitchy about what you were talking about. After a short time she goes up stairs to go back to sleep. Lately she has been locking her kids room for whatever reason. She then wakes up to pick her kids up from school and as soon as they get home she starts screaming at them again. My niece (9F) is on the spectrum for autism and  suffers from irritable bowl syndrome (type C) like I (27M) do as well. My sister in law is always threatening to give her an enemas because she is always constipated so she finds it painful to go. While threatening her with enemas my sister in law walks off laughing about it like it's some kinda of sick joke. 

After this my sister in law sits around and talks a whole gang of shit about other people's business and takes a million selfies while ignoring her kids unless she is screaming at them over little stuff. If you offer any sort of criticism about what she has done or is going she is quick to snap at you like everything she does is perfect. She then takes to Facebook to make status about criticizing you and brings up the fact she could sue you for slander. The moment my kids (3F,1M) interact with her kids my sister screams and demands that her kids go upstairs with no real reasoning at all. Then it's time for dinner after everyone has eaten her kids will ask for more food. My sister in law and my older brother (29M) will ignore their kids asking for more food or tell them they will be spanked for bothering them. Most of the time they just sit there on their phones ignoring their kids asking for more food while making snide comments. An example of this is my nephew (5M) asked for a spoon yesterday and my sister in law told him ""Big kids don't fucking use spoons you wanna be a baby then I'll treat you like a baby"". My Mother (51F) brought up the fact she was using a spoon and there is no difference between using a fork or a spoon for eating dinner. My sister in law just ignored this then proceed to scream at the family dog for being on the couch even tho she is allowed to be on the couch and ever was never an issue with this before. 

Prior to moving in my Sister in law would be just as rude to my mother (51F). An example of this is one day my mom made chicken strips and my Sister in law told my mom she didn't need to eat any more for lunch she told my mom""She is fat enough"" and she didn't need lunch or dinner that day.  Her and my older brother (29M) have told my mom they are going to ""move out"" and my mother wouldn't ""be allowed to see the kids ever again"". Then before leaving the house he would disconnect the wifi router and cable box taking them with him even tho he wasn't paying for the internet or cable bills. My mom's name is on the lease and no one else,'s name is on it so technically it's my moms house and everyone is just staying with her. 

My question is how to approach my sister in law about what's troubling her or telling her she really needs to get some help with whatever is going on? I am concerned for constant state of anger/pissy/constant screaming at her kids. I don't get how you can be a caregiver and exhibit this kind of behavior in your regular everyday life."
367,Broke up with my boyfriend of two years over me finding his instagram and seeing all the naked girls he follows on it. Its really dumb but it made me feel like angry and sad. I dont know how to get over this problem of mine. I dont consider myself like ugly or anything so I dont think my self esteem is that bad but I still feel this way. I talk to him about it but he refuses to do anything about it. I have to figure it out on my own. Any one have advice for me?
368,"Off the bat, I wanna apologize if this is not the right place, it was just my best guess. 

I’ve been seeing this girl for about 9 months now and they’ve been great. We get along really well, and I believe that leads to a more emotion and a stronger relationship. I love her and all she’s great but I can’t understand why I’m losing the same fire. 

For instance when we first started talking, I was nothing but infatuated and now I find myself working to make conversation so she can be happy and not see the energy I’m losing. It’s hard to explain but the little things like getting excited when she would come over or when she would say nice things; they haven’t lost meaning but they just don’t feel as significant. As if they’re just becoming the motions we’re going through BECAUSE we’re together. I feel really bad about it but I’ve also thought about other girls recently because they just seem to be more enticing and I don’t exactly understand why they seem so attractive. I’ll never cheat on anyone but it’s just a guilty thought to have I think. 

That being said, I do love her very much. She’s a sweet person who’s only ever been hurt in relationships (this is my only first ever serious one anyway). My question is has anyone else had this problem, where things just become...bland? Or is it just my self destructive tendency at play? And if it’s something I should bring up, would there be a light way to talk about this?

369,"so basically me and my girlfriend have gotten pregnant and we are now at 24 weeks and 5 days and I need to tell my parents soon as i still live with them and that i am both wanting this baby and wanting to move out to live with my girlfriend so that we can raise this child but i dont know where to even begin to approach this conversation, now they are in america till the 1st of december so i wont see them till they get back so i want to have a prepared way to do this, can anybody help."
370,"i love my boyfriend so much, we have been together for almost two years now.
i want to do things to remind him of how special he is to me, that i think of him as a man and that i appreciate him endlessly.
any suggestions?"
371,"So I dont really know how to start this,  but a long time friend (20F) and I(20M) have been in this little ""patch"". I do like her and she has said that she has liked me too but it's just circumstances. She came over one day and we almost had sex, but she had to go home early because her family needed her. And that was the end of it. 

She got a boyfriend, and he lives like two hours away. They've dated and I got my answer about being in a relationship 
through her actions and we drifted apart for a while. 

Recently we started to hang out again and I've noticed that she starts this whole ""thing"" like for instance she once said "" You could've called me the day after and could've continued where we left off~""(this happened a year ago). I told her that I didnt think she be ok with that and I didnt want to come across as the smash and dash kind of guy. Then she said ""maybe one day we can"". 

I told her that I did have feelings for her but I respected her choices. Granted I wasnt sure what do becuase of the whole red-green light attitude shes given me. 

A part of me believes she is leading me on for attention. But I hear from others that she does like me and does like the idea of me being her boyfriend. 

I asked about her current bf and she said the whole long distance thing wasnt working and she said she ""loved me"" but wasnt sure about her current bf. 
""I just miss  our thing"" is what she told me. 

I havent talked to her since and that was about a week ago.

She says she knows my feelings for her but.... I just feel like she is just saying this for attention. I mean she got another boyfriend,right?"
372,"I posted here a a few days ago about a guy I know at work. I said that I had a college class with him and I didn't know if he thought of me as a friend or not. I basically said that he never started conversations and that I was always initiating, but every time we spoke I felt like we were good friends. 

I deleted my post because the advice was shitty and messed with my head. I had a few people respond with only judgement. Not helpful. However one person simply asked me to ask him why he doesn't talk to me. Spoiler, I didn't do this. BUT, something clicked in my head yesterday and I ended up almost completely understanding his position.

Long story short we had a conversation yesterday and some things led to another, he definitely likes me as a friend. I wish I could say more as to how I know, but anonymity is extremely important here. I can definitely say there is strong trust coming from both sides of this relationship 

Thanks to that one person who helped"
373,"So my girlfriend(21F)has had it with me(22M)finding ways that she’s being un reasonable or always giving solutions when she vents( big or little things) . So she tells me “maybe I need to find someone else to vent to”. Does it sound like we are in trouble, and what should I do? I clearly love her and want to save this so please be blunt.

We have been dating for 2 years, and are doing a long distance relationship. But we recently just saw each other."
374,"I met this friend online 6 months ago because he completed the same masters program as me and was also part of another group we had in common. We turned out to really get along and work together from time to time. He invited me to his work Christmas dinner as a plus one and I told him I'd think about it since I am in a relationship and I didn't know if it would be appropriate. I consulted a couple people and decided it would be fun and eye opening to go, so I let him know. He told me not to get mad but that he needs to re-think about it. He told me to tell him he did nothing wrong. I told him I can't say that because generally speaking it's rude to un-invite someone after you've invited them. He then told me he has to go, tried to hang up, and I asked him to talk for a few more minutes so it won't be an angry ending to an otherwise pleasant conversation. He hung up anyway then texted me saying he needs to block my number to clear his head. I told him if he blocks me then I never want to speak to him again. He blocked me. 

Am I an asshole? (yes, wrong sub). But seriously, do I end this friendship? My heart goes out to anxious people but, to be honest, I really can't deal with it. I hate feeling like I have to watch every word I say so he doesn't freak out and run away from me."
375,"Hi everyone. A bit of background on me and my girlfriend: We met in class last year and after a few weeks of talking I got the courage to ask her out. We have been together ever since (around 10 months) and so far it’s amazing. We really connect in a way I’ve never had with anyone before. I never stop thinking about her. As far as personality goes, we are really similar. We share the same tv/movie tastes, sense of humor, and we are both somewhere between introverts and extroverts. 

Our backgrounds however, are extremely different. She grew up very privileged, went to private school, in a safe and generally wealthy area. I grew up in a poverty stricken inner city area where violence and drugs are a big issue. I got into this school on scholarship otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to go to college. 

This has never been an issue with us, in fact we both take a lot of interest in each other’s lives because we grew up so differently. She’s not spoiled at all, in fact quite modest and down to earth. I had to swallow my pride a few times when she wanted to go somewhere nice to eat that I just couldn’t afford, and it was hard to let her pay because I was always taught the man should provide. But that has been the only time there was a conflict about our financial differences and it was kind of my fault. 

I visited her hometown to meet her parents last month- and she is a lot richer than she previously let on. Her parent’s house is beautiful, on the water, her area is so nice and great to walk around in. We went out to expensive steak dinners and all that. They had a nice guest bedroom for me (her parents are rather conservative and although I’m sure they know we have sex and sleep in the same bed, it’s their house so I stayed in there), and a fancy dining room. I was so intimidated by this, I don’t really know anything about this world and I felt put of place sometimes even though everyone was nice to me. 

The plan for her to come visit my hometown was in place before that trip- but now I’m hesitating. I feel like there are many things that could go wrong. Now that I know what she’s used to, I’m realizing that from her POV she will be slumming it. She’s going to stay in my tiny ass room with me because that’s where there’s room. We won’t be able to walk around late at night because it’s dangerous. I’m going to take her out, but only to the cheap and kind of trashy restaurants I can afford around here. People around here can be rude to strangers and there are sometimes street fights. Junkies on the corner doing stupid shit. 

There’s also the issue that I am a black guy who comes from a black area and I only dated black girls in high school, and my girlfriend is white. That’s kind of a negatively viewed stereotype around where I’m from, poor black guy from the hood leaves and comes back with a rich white girlfriend, people view that as me trying to reject my culture or thinking I’m above the people I grew up around. It’s not like that at all, I love my girlfriend for who she is and the color of her skin is very low on the list of things I find beautiful about her. I know people are going to make fun of her because she speaks very classy and “white.” 

I don’t know. I’m riddled with insecurity now. I don’t want my girlfriend to think I’m ghetto and I don’t want people to be mean to her. I’m afraid she’ll realize what dating a poor guy is actually like and will trade me out for someone who knows her experiences more. Maybe I’m being crazy? Is this something that can be a real problem in relationships?"
376,"I’ve been with “Jake” since January, but we’ve been a bit on and off and are currently in the process of getting back together. A couple weeks ago he mentioned to me that he went to to lunch to catch up with his “friend” (I’ll call her Ashley). A day or two after they went to lunch, he was staying over at my place and told me that Ashley had texted him that she broke up with her long term boyfriend (Jake mentioned to me that she said that they were having issues). Me and Jake ended up going to drinks with Ashley and her friends that night.

We were talking about Ashley before going to drinks, because he had never mentioned her by name until now, and it came up that Jake and Ashley had slept together in the past, but I already suspected that they had because of the way he talked about her, and I don’t mind those kind of things so I didn’t think anything of it. I asked Jake to tell me about her, and he told me that they knew each other from work when they were in high school. 

While we were at drinks, Ashley said things like “when me and Jake were dating...” a couple of times, and I was a little surprised because Jake never mentioned that they actually dated. I got the impression from their interactions that they were old friends who didn’t see each other very often. In the time after this there have been one or two instances where I’m with Jake and he’ll mention that he’s texting Ashley, one of these times I commented on something that he told me about their conversation and he said that I didn’t understand, and told me how close they were... but I had never even heard of this girl until a few weeks ago. The thing that surprised me is that I was with Jake yesterday until the evening and then he went home, and when I saw him again today he told me about this big realization he made in his life, and then he also mentioned advice that Ashley had given him on it. I don’t think that he saw Ashley in person because she lives a bit further from us, but I was just surprised that he would’ve talked to her about this in such a short time span. 

I usually wouldn’t mind something like this because I don’t believe that I should prevent him from being friends with someone that he’s known longer than me, but I find it odd that he never mentioned her before this (and he mentions a lot of his friends by name, even if I’ve never met them). I’m not sure if this is just me being insecure, or if I have a right to be curious. I also don’t know how to bring it up without it being accusatory."
377, Basically the Title. Constant cycle that I know has no potential for a future.  But I make little more than minimum wage and I’ve committed to a year lease with him. I feel so alone with no options and have no idea what to do.  He’s violent and I can’t put up with it anymore.
378,"I never thought it was a bad thing until coming on here and seeing everyone talk about how toxic it is to know your partners location all the time. My boyfriend and I have them shared with each other, but I don’t look at it unless he’s driving somewhere so I can see he is still traveling and when he arrives safely. And it’s not like I’m constantly watching it, just check every now and then until he’s arrived safely and then I stop. I have a huge fear of him getting into some kind of accident or random event so it eases my fear a lot. Idk what he uses mine for, but I assume something similar, as he isn’t ever quizzing me about where I am or what I’m doing. I think we have a very healthy relationship with a lot of trust, love and security. We are also currently in different states too, so that’s another reason for the shared locations. Is this a toxic behavior ?"
379,"&amp;#x200B;

My fiance (25 M) and I (26 F) have been on and off for nearly seven years. We met in high school and tried long distance when I moved to college. It wasn't serious at the time. After he graduated he moved to the city I was attending school in, but ""not for me"", but because it was where he wanted to go to school as well. Our second year of dating, we broke up and we were ""friends"" until I transferred to a new school. We were apart for about a year when one of us reached out to the other. We chatted a bit but I knew he was not making the best life choices. He turned to drugs and hanging out with the wrong type of people. He ended up getting convicted of a minor criminal offense and his life continued into a down hill spiral. Soon enough, he had a pending felony burglary charge for entering into a friends house to retrieve his things (very simplified version). He was still using drugs of all sorts and spiraling.

I had come home unplanned, we had been texting a bit but were friends and I truly cared and was scared because he hadn't returned any of my messages for a week. I decided to drive by the ""drug house"" and sure enough he was there. I went inside and forced him to come and have a conversation with me about what he was doing with his life. He confessed that he was miserable and suicidal and getting high was how he coped. I still cared about him and knew he was better than this. We talked about how hanging around these people was not helping and that he needs to move on. That night, he packed a bag and rode back with me to my apartment four hours away. I helped him get sober. I help him get a job. I helped him resolve his pending case. He became the person that I recognized and loved once before. That was about four years ago almost to date.

Since then, we have been together. We have laughed, loved, dreamed of the future, and got through some bumps along the way. I decided that I wanted to pursue graduate school. He supported me and we moved three hours closer to home.  Being closer to our families is great because we spend much more time with them, well as much as can be spent outside work and graduate school. Going to graduate school was REALLY scary for me because I had been our rock for so long. I had been the one working and paying for the majority of the bills while he sorted his life out. Going to graduate school meant that I had to let go of the reins and hope that he would be there to catch them.

He did take the reins while I began graduate school. He worked and supported us both while I focused on my studies. After my first semester, I got a bartending gig for extra cash to help out. Then I got a low paying job in my field while I continued my education. Last October, he proposed to me out of the blue. I was not expecting it but was pleasantly surprised because I knew I wanted to spend my life with him. I said yes and we decided that we did not want to get married until after I finished graduate school and completed my board exams. We tentatively planned a date for fall of 2020. We began wedding planning a bit and booked a venue and a few other venders by the end of summer. We took our engagement photos and we both are all smiles. I can feel the love just looking at them. He mentioned that he wanted a home that he can work on and call his own. We began house hunting. He found out that he was likely a carrier for cystic fibrosis so he got tested. He came back positive but for a mild form. He asked me to get tested. I made the appointment with my doctor to refer me.

The beginning of October 2019, he decided to take a planned boys trip to Colorado. I knew that it meant that he would be smoking and drinking but thought he would be alright. We texted and he said that he wished I was there, that we have to go back and do it together. I said that I would love to do that someday and perhaps we can plan it as a honeymoon or something. I was happy that he had fun. He began smoking when he returned from Colorado and it turned into an everyday thing. Last weekend, the first weekend back since his trip, I went out of town to visit my family. He stayed home. I was a bit upset because I really wanted him to be there, but understood that he was tired from his travel and work. I returned home Sunday and all seemed to be fine. I apologized for being crabby and that was the end of it despite him acting strange.

On Monday, he got home from work and smelt like pot. I asked if he had smoked and he said he smoked in his car on his drive home. I thought and voiced that I thought that was not very smart of him given that it is illegal in our state. He rolled it off. I let him be but knew something was up. Despite how mad I knew it would make him, I looked at his phone while he was in the shower. I did it primarily to see if he was texting people for other drugs and to see if there was someone else he was talking too. I did not find anything except for some casual snapchat conversations with some girls, none looked like he was cheating rather just having a casual conversation with.

I confronted him regarding what was going on, and asked why he was acting so strange. He the told me that he doesn't want to be with me anymore that he is unhappy with our relationship and has been for months if not the last year. This was news to me because I thought we were doing great. WE talk about literally everything almost everyday. He is my person and my best friend. I asked him what he is unhappy with but he couldn't give me any answers. He said it's nothing with me but rather he needs to be a lone wolf and a free spirit. He claims it's not the drugs or that he is seeing anyone else. I asked if we could chat about it when he wasn't high and we agreed to talk on Tuesday evening.

On Tuesday, we chatted. I told him that I know there are things that I need to fix and get better at but I am working on it. I told him that I know adulting sucks but we can try to make it better. Let's figure out what you need to be happy. Whether that be a different job, more trips, more time for him, but he couldn't point to anything. I asked him if we could try because to me it wasn't fair that he had felt this way for so long but never told me. He said that trying won't fix anything because it's nothing I can change. I asked what he saw in his future. He said he didn't know beyond that he sees himself as being alone. I want to make it work with him but I cannot want it for both of us. I also feel that we deserve a chance to try now that I know.

I love this man and I have pictured a future together with him. I want to make things work but I just don't know how. I don't know how we can go from wedding planning, engagement pictures, house hunting, to genetic testing for our future kids to breaking up all in less than a month. Keep in mind, I don't care about being married or a home, I just want to be with one another. He says that he loves me and cares about me and I believe him but just do not believe that he doesn't want to be with me.

Synopsis: Fiance (25M) want to break up with me (26F) after 4 years of a seemingly happy relationship. He thinks he is unhappy and that there is nothing that can be done to fix it. He thinks that he is a ""free spirit"" and ""lone wolf"" and doesn't see a future with anyone. I want to stay with him but I know I cannot force him."
380,"First of all, throwaway cause he's got reddit. Probably wouldn't see it anyway cause he mostly stays on warhammer subreddits but better safe than sorry.

So as the title says, I (17F) have a boyfriend (17M). We have been going pretty strong for a few months now, and I am honestly so incredibly happy with him. He's so sweet and polite, and he always listens to me, and we go on dates and kiss and all that sappy stuff. But now I want to 'take it further' so to say. I have had sex before, so for me personally, it is a non-issue. (BTW we are both of the legal age of consent in our state so that is a non-issue here)

Unfortunately he has too, just not in a good way. He has confided in me (after a few months of being together, not just off the bat) that he was drugged and raped at a friends party when he was 15. He has told me he hasn't gone to a house party since, and that as a result of it, sex kind of scares him.

Now this is absolutely terrible, I very nearly started crying when he told me, and I could tell he was too, but it suddenly made so much sense. He never drinks because that's how he got drugged, he doesn't go to house parties, he always asks permission before touching me in anyway, even if it's just to hold my hand, his extreme emphasis on consent suddenly feeling totally explained.

But I do want to have sex with him, and I feel that he would say yes for me, but would be scared the whole time. We have 'fooled around' before, but it's obvious he's scared when he's 'receiving', and has such has a propensity for 'giving' (which is honestly pretty great for me but that's not the point). Seriously, his legs start shaking and he can barely keep himself from hyperventilating.

I really just want to show him that one bad (read; horrible) incident isn't the whole picture, but I don't know how to make him feel comfortable.

Should I talk to him about it? If so how? I 'd rather not consider it, but should I not even attempt? Our relationship is very strong even without it, and I'm very confident our relationship would not fall apart. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

TL:DR: My boyfriend had a very bad experience when he was younger and is scared of sexual intimacy, and I would rather like to have sex with him. Looking for advice."
381,"I’ve been with my current boyfriend for over 5 months now, and even tho our relationship started off bumpy in the first month, things only went uphill from there. We love eachother very much and care for one another, that’s never been an issue. But recently we got into a heated argument and he ended up confessing that even tho he feels loved and appreciated with me, he thinks the relationship isn’t doing him any good because I’m demotivated. The thing is, he says that because for the past 3 months he’s been telling me to get rid of a certain friend that is toxic for me. I always understood him and knew that the friend was bad for me but it took me some time to get rid of her since it’s not that easy to give up on a 2 year + friendship. But he keeps on telling me I’m not doing anything and that hurts him as well, hence he doesn’t feel good anymore. That and he says I stopped putting in effort prior to when we first started dating. Ever since that talk, I’ve been devasted, but I tried hiding it as best as I could. I stopped talking to that friend definitively and I started going out of my way to become the person I once was when we first started dating. He noticed it and he says he feels better than ever now that he knows I can change and do good for us, but the thing is, I can’t get what he said out of my head. That he doesn’t feel like the relationship is good for him. Truth is I haven’t ate good in days and I never get enough sleep. I’m always stressed and afraid I might say the wrong thing and set him off and potentially make him break up with me. I’m always crying and my head constantly hurts and on top of that, I have to move schools and leave everyone behind which just adds to everything. I feel as if I’ve lived a trauma and now everything seems dark and ugly for me, and that is a problem since I used to be a very lively person and always happy. What should I do ? I feel as if I’m completely helpless."
382,"Hi, I have been with my girlfriend for about 3 weeks, but as of the 27th, coming up here, it will be a month.  I can't really tell if the feelings I'm feeling for her are just like, really strong, or if Its love.  Just about every night, we are telling each other how happy we make each other, saying cute stuff, etc.  She kissed me first and I felt terrible about it because there were multiple times where she kinda put herself out there and I didn't act because I wasn't sure if she wanted me to or not... 
Anyways, I told myself that I wanted to be the one to say I love you first, to kind of repay her back, but I don't want to act too fast and scare her off.  What should I do?"
383,"I've been having a on/off crush on my best friend. We tell each other everything, go out a lot, and joke around. I'm always happy when I see her smile or laugh. But the one problem is that she's into guys unlike me. Just to put it out there I'm a geek/nerd that enjoys sports, but I'm overweight. She's into those guys that workout a shit ton. She always complains about not having a boyfriend and always has a crush on someone who's like way better looking then me. I had a really bad incidents with 2 of her friends (I tried going for them nothing ever happened) but I have a really good feeling about her it's just she's into guys that aren't like me. When I need someone to talk to she's there and when she's needs someone I'm there it's just I don't know if I should risk it and get reject and our friendship goes downhill. BTW I'm in high school we plan to go to the same college or a college near each other to see each other. Should I wait, risk it now, or just hold it in ?"
384,"So at work today and I have co workers around me ""It's a small office"" and my wife calls and finds out that I ordered a male sex toy and asks me about if I ordered it, I tell her I have no idea in a moment of weakness trying to make sure she stops talking about it and takes the hint. She instead questions me more starting to name the thing over the phone, me freaking out that she might just blurt out the thing says I don't know lying about it and get off the phone. Later to her I explain the situation in text messages but she doesn't wanna hear it and is now mad  that lied and didn't own up to it when she asked originally. After this the convo divulged into arguing and her saying it's ok to lie now and just overall acting crazy. No idea if I am in the wrong here by not telling her originally about buying that for myself, but I feel I am not wrong for lying to get her off my back when she's trying to bring that up while we are both at work."
385,"We've been together for 2 years, I genuinely love him and can see myself being with him for the rest of my life! But over the past 6 months he's developer an unhealthy obsession with porn, and he's blaming it on an incident we had earlier this year.


**The incident**


I should preface this by saying my boyfriend has had problems with feeling insecure about the size of his penis for a long time, and it even affected our sex life early in the relationship trying to figure out positions and ways in which I could enjoy sex.


This is definitely a problem we had that was my fault. We were in a parking lot after seeing a movie, and we were talking and joking about families that were weirdly too open and close, without thinking about how it might sound I mentioned my ex's family and how his mother once said to me ""I knew he'd grow up to have a big dick since he was a kid"". My boyfriend instantly had a mood switch and seemed fairly uncomfortable, I realised I shouldn't have said it immediately from his reaction. He asked me if it was big and at that point I thought I should just be completely honest because if I lie now and the truth comes out later he'll be much more hurt, so I told him that it was. He asked a few more follow up questions and we had an awkward drive home. The next day he brought it up and we had a long talk about it and from the outcome there I thought it was over.


**Problems over the past 6 months**


Problems started a bit after this incident, but honestly I think that because I thought it was solved that the two things weren't related. Long story short he started having issues finishing during sex and losing erections, he told me that he just wasn't really in the mood but wanted to please me anyway and I left it at that because I thought it was a perfectly normal situation, even I've not been in the mood and gone along with it. But gradually over time it kept happening to the point where he was consistently not being able to finish every time. Around a month ago I caught him in the bathroom masturbating to porn after we had tried and failed to have sexual intercourse again and to be honest I got a bit mad at him. He admitted to me that he's been doing this every single time that it's happened.


**The porn**


This again is something I shouldn't have done and I regret breaching his trust here, but I snooped on his phone to try and see what he was watching, I think I had some feelings of inadequacy that he was getting off to that but couldn't finish in bed with me, and I was honestly a bit annoyed considering the rocky start to our sexual relationship. The porn he's been watching is exclusively interracial (black male white female) with some quite hardcore fetishy stuff. This is when the incident earlier and his behaviour over time connected in my head as the ex we discussed was black.


**Confrontation**


Once I linked these events in my head I felt like he's having some deeper issues with insecurity that we needed to talk about (or him talk to a therapist about) and honestly at that point I had it solid in my head we needed to talk about it. In short he told me that since he found out he relates the image of me sexually with my ex and that at this point he can only get off to thinking about me with him and that it was my fault for saying what I said 6 months ago.


**My dilemma**


I feel like this was my fault, I see his point of view and I don't know what to do now. I know I was wrong and regret making that comment about my ex's family knowing he would struggle with the comparison. I felt like I was finally being able to enjoy sex with him and this has reversed a year and a half of progress.


Outside of sex, I consider our relationship amazing and have no other complaints


Did I make any wrong moves in this situation? Is there going back? What do I even say to him now? How do I handle this situation?


Tldr 

A comment that led to the discussion of the size of my ex's dick has led to my boyfriend becoming unable to finish during sex, and him developing an unhealthy porn obsession. He blames this on me for making the comment and I'm unsure on how to go further"
386,"I want to start off saying that I absolutely can tell the difference between my bf and his brother. If you know twins and have one in your family or you date one, then after a while its very easy to tell the apart. But I admit at first it was hard to. But we been together for a year now, so its definitely easy to.

So last night we invited his brother and his new gf over, and we watched tv, we drank, and we smoked. We were having a good time. I got pretty drunk and tired, and laid on the floor to sleep. They kept going for maybe 30 mins before it quieted down. I heard his brother go to the back to the other bedroom to sleep and my bf was snoring beside me.

Well it was like in the middle of the night I got up because I wanted water, and it was dark, and when I went back to lay down with my bf on the floor, his back was to me, so I put my arm around him, and tbh I was horny, so I started to play with him. I put my hand on him and was making him hard. I heard him whisper are you sure? So I kept going... he rolled over and pushed me on my tummy, and got on top of me and was whispering how hot I was. And we had sex.

I fell asleep and woke up before him in the morning. When I looked over it was my brother's twin!!! I was freaking out inside, I didn't say anything, I got up and hurried to our bedroom and my bf was in the bed!! So I didn't say anything, I got in and he woke up and kissed me and I was just saying I was really tired. Well he got up and went to work.

His brother didn't say anything to us this morning, because his gf was still here, and he hugged me and missed my forhead and left. So I am here. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE??? I am like omfg at my mistake right now!!!"
387,"Title says it all. Me and her broke up split back in febuary, then we play mind warfare for about 4 months before cutting contact. We dated for two years, it certainly had it's ups and downs, like any young relationship, but the love was really fucking pure, unlike anything I've ever experienced. We made plans to get married, make a life together. Split happened in February as my depression and substance abuse got the better of me (I smoked weed and had a few drinks every night after work, and she was sober throughout relationship, having had substance abuse issues in the past herself, but still loving me regardless of mine) and I felt as though I wasn't moving forward with my life (and I wasn't, it really was just work and love life, my hobbies were almost non existent and I never saw my friends as her and I spent every moment we weren't working together). After the initial split, we made up and started to work things out, but her family really disliked me at that point, four daughters, one mum, dad was a POS for having hurt her to begin with. I'll add the night of the split wasn't pretty. She wouldn't talk to me, clearly upset with me, and it was getting like this more often, literally rolling over and just avoiding me in my bed, I told her I was done, that she should leave and that we shouldn't see each other again. Yeah, I'm a fucking asshole at times, learning my lessons through my mistakes. Anyways, as I said, got back together, things were going well. She goes to Toronto for a week with her family, and the game changed. She hardly spoke with me and got cold and distant. Then she came back, avoided me for a week, then at last, invited me over to ""talk"" and broke up with me on her front porch really coldly, it was like meeting another person. That's when the mind wars set in, still talking over social media, her not being present for me and I could tell she started talking to other guys, as a means to get over me as fast as possible. I'll add in right now that I've had other partners before in life, and I realized how much she meant to me. I was her first boyfriend, and she had trauma from her father, so there were many barriers to break through in order for us to connect. Anyways. Fast forward to my daily life. I'm an apprentice who keeps himself busy with work and my passions have come back full force. I also have stopped smoking weed, and greatly reduced my drinking. I've been in love with her since and really have had some intense psychedelic and sober experiences where the love I have for her comes out immensely, my heart is broken, mending sure, but I really love that cat still. We don't talk anymore on social media, really just too painful as she was just brushing me off and really cold, I know she is angry with me, very much so, for breaking her heart, and I understand. Shes in college now. Maybe shes seeing another guy, I wouldn't be surprised as she is a beautiful, intelligent young woman. Yet every day she is on my mind still, a tether I cant seem to shake. I really want to reconnect and talk. She doesn't want that, everything I brought it up for closure she just says "" you never gave that to me, i had to work through everything on my own, so should you"", really I can just feel her pain coming out. Anyways folks, my heart could use some wisdom and advice. I know I should probably move forward, but in my heart, i still love her. If you love something, you should let it go, this is true, but ultimately why give real love away? Is there any way I can talk to her and make amends, or do I walk the plank and let it be? 
TLDR: I'm still in love with my ex girlfriend. We don't talk anymore, haven't for about a month. I really want see her again and close this wound or heal it and move forward with her, but everytime I ask she really gets angry and hurt, because she says why would she do that for me when I never did that for her. She is younger and in college now with little life experience. I've already been through alot of what she has yet to experience, and really am happy with myself, but outside of that i know i still love her. Do i let this go? If so, what's the best way to get over heartache? The last time i had a breakup that was close to this magnitude, i dropped out of college and found myself attempting to heal in Peru, drinking ayahuasca, which is an experience, however lovely and redeeming it was, that I am not ready to replicate."
388,"Mandatory ""this is a throwaway account""

This is my first time posting so I apologize if the formatting is wrong or for anything else I messed up on. Im going to try to make it detailed but also short. Im just at a loss and I dont know what to do, I dont know who I can talk to about this or how to process my emotions. TL;DR at the bottom.

A little bit of backstory: me and my friend met 3 years ago in college when I was 19. We instantly became close and began to hang out and talk a lot. After about a month or so, we started dating. It was really casual and not too serious so when he graduated 8 months later, we broke up and he moved. Since then, hes moved back and weve both dated other people while still remaining good friends and were both single now. Despite everything weve been through, we've always been there for each other. He told me that he still has feelings for me but doesn't let it affect our friendship. 

What happened: We hang out once or twice a week and we'll usually end up hanging out at one of our places because we're broke and cant afford to go out and do stuff often. Occasionally (maybe once every other week, if that) I'll go to his place and drink and just crash there so I dont drive drunk. I usually end up sleeping in his bed because its more comfortable than the couch but nothing ever happens, we hadnt had sex since we dated 3 years ago. Last week we hung out at his place and drank and watched tv. I had about 2 to 3 drinks so I was a little drunk by the end of the night but not even close to being wasted or out of control. I ended up going to sleep at around 11pm. At around 1am (I know this because I checked the time after it happened) I have two really hazy memories. The first memory is him eating me out and the second memory is him pulling out and finishing on top of me but both of those memories are so blurry and hazy, it felt like a dream so much to the point where after it happened, I wasnt sure if I was dreaming it or if it actually happened. After that, I guess I finally realized I slept with him because I remember being more conscious and asking myself ""what just happened, did that actually just happen"". Everything after that I remember clearly, he handed me my shorts and asked me if I was okay because I guess I looked uncomfortable and I asked him if we had sex, when he said yes I quickly grabbed all my stuff and drove home. He kept asking me what's wrong and why I'm freaking out. 

After it happened, I was so confused and shocked and uncomfortable. I dont know how it happened because nothing like that has ever happened to me before where I did something with someone and didnt remember it. I've gotten way more drunk in the past but still havent done anything like that. When I left his house I wasnt drunk, it felt more like I was just asleep or not completely conscious or awake when it happened. I didnt get blacked out drunk or wasted.

A few things I need to clarify, he said I woke him up and initiated everything and he was drunk so he just went with it and didn't question it. After I told him the next day that i have no memory of it or how it happened, he seemed disappointed because he thought i consciously hooked up with him and it meant I wanted to get back together and now he feels guilty because he didnt stop me. I just started a new antidepressant and I read online that it could increase chances of sleepwalking if you drink so maybe that's what caused it to happen and me not remember it? Also, because I know someone might suggest this, he would never put something in my drink or take advantage of me like that. Besides, I poured my own drinks and had it with me the whole time.

I told him I need a few days to process everything but I just dont know what to do. I feel like I was assaulted even though that's obviously not what happened. He did nothing wrong because he had no way of knowing I wasnt completely conscious but I just feel so weird and uncomfortable. I still want to be friends with him but I dont know how to make things go back to normal for me. Any advice would be really appreciate, I just need help processing what happened. I dont know where we go from here. 

TL;DR hung out with my friend last week, we drank and I crashed there, woke up to us having sex. I dont remember anything and the parts I do remember is hazy and blurry. He didnt put anything in my drink, I might have been ""sleepwalking"" because of this medicine I started taking. I don't know how to process this or where we go from here

Edit: it might be worth mentioning that I sleptwalked into my roommates room a few weeks ago and talked to them while asleep but have no memory of doing so, I only know this because they told me. I think i was ""sleepwalking"" this time also"
389,"I’ve always been drawn to men who can’t financially take care of themselves. In the beginning it’s all about the looks, the sex, the fun. Then I get into a curve of buying him things this and that, then after maybe some months I become upset of him for not doing anything for me and I cut it off. Why am I so ugly about this?? Why do I constantly fall for these men.. how can I get out of me “let me care for you” mode? It’s not that I don’t have enough money to not be able to support myself on top of my “too nice” of ways it’s just .. I always feel the need to please the man. Then once he can’t do the same to me I become mad. I don’t expect a lot, hell I’d be happy with a build a bear and a candle. 
Advice please?"
390,"So me (19f) and my boyfriend (23m) sometimes sleep together at my place alone. So I have a dog and a cat and they’ve been used to sleeping with me on my bed for their whole lives. The thing is, my boyfriends skin is very sensitive so none of the pets can get on the bed without him getting itchy or them scratching themselves and he wakes up. He gets upset when he’s sleepy and gets upset with me. So I’ve tried keeping dog off of bed and tonight went horrendously because my bf went and wanted them both out of my room for the night. 

So the thing about my dog is that she HATES being left out of a room when I’m the only person at home (same applies to my mom). She will scratch at the door and bark for literal hours. He said it was fine. I said ok and tried to make it work. I just barely was able to fall asleep. I don’t think my bf was able to. 

I woke up at around 5 am to my dog and bf on his phone. I asked if he could fall asleep and he replied with no but without saying no. So I got up and bring my dog’s bed inside and had her try to sleep on that instead. It worked. It’s quiet and bf is asleep. But I don’t know what to do in the future? Because when he’s not with me, my dog is on the bed with me. It not that she’s violent either, she just scratches herself a lot and that wakes my bf up since he’s a light sleeper. 

I don’t know what to do now because he’s going to complain and blame me in the morning about getting no sleep. So should I just not have him sleep over anymore?"
391,"My friend make fun of me because I often go to the toilet I have a little bladder and I have  problems with that since childhood. Sometimes I go every hour mainly when I get nervous, problem is that one girl from my group of friends (5 girls) noticed and constantly draw attention to it and made fun of it every time we are going out but also on group chat, not only in front of me but also behind my back and I don't know what to do, I'm not comfortable in this situation, because it reminds me of childhood when I being bullied for it. This whole thing makes me really sad because for first time I felt comfortable in group of people and she points out to something that is sensitive for me and make me depressed because I again feel like I'm not normal also when one or two girls join her doesn't help.

I don't know what to do right now. Please do anyone know how to deal with this? What would you do in my situation?"
392,"He’s the story.  My wife is a great woman and mother to our 10 month old daughter. However, ever since we bought our house three years ago she has gotten into the habit of letting strays live with us. By that I mean if any one of her female friends is in a pinch with a housing situation or a job my wife will ride in on her white horse and offer them a place to stay rent free for as long as they need. 

    This has happened four times in three years and for the previous three “rent free tenants” I have had a problem with it but whenever I say anything she just guilts me into letting them stay. Because  “without us they would be homeless”. Problem is now I don’t feel like I have a home. Ffs. 

    Anyways the fourth woman who happens to be my wife’s best friend  had a living situation fall apart in an bad way. Cops and the like. And of course my wife rides in and offer her a place to live for fing free naturally. Now we live 25km from town so car is needed to go anywhere. This woman has no car and is on medical EI. Now after two weeks she gets a job at a hardware store and then we had to drive he butt  into and from work every bloody day.  But at least she is working right?

   Then I find out last week that the gov said she had another 36 weeks of regular EI available. So this woman quits her full time job to go on assistance so she can get her GED and drivers license........WTF.  I know everyone is different but I got my bachelors and worked full time my wife did the same with her Bachelors in nursing. 

Anyways, I lost it on my wife recently (just an argument). And told her that this habit of rescuing her friends has to stop. And that I personally can not save everyone of them. These woman are all in their late 20s and 30s and should be able to fend for themselves. And that as a husband and a father I need to have time with my wife and baby without another ass on the couch. I ended by telling her that this is the last time anyone is ever staying with us beyond a out of town visit or I was packing my bags and going to live in a motel. 

Did I go to far? What would my play here be? 

Her response is for me to cool off.  But I come home and her friend is everywhere I want to go.  

I married my wife not her deadbeat friend. But in three years I have had 4 unwanted roommates and they always cost me money to feed and shelter.  Also I work 40-60 hours a week with travel out of town. And my family time is paramount in my life. I just don’t understand why my feelings on this are not paramount to my wife. 

Any thoughts or advise to remedy or to stop this from ever happening again would be appreciated. I love my wife but I’m at my wits end."
393,"I've been dating this absolute sweetheart from almost about a year now and for the past few months she's had it really tough (I won't get into it bc privacy reasons) and of course I've been there to help her and support her all the way through this year and she managed to get through her final school year extremely successfully despite her hard circumstances.

So to get back to my actual question, what's a great way to show her ""hey great job this year I'm proud of you"" bc I've already told her that 100's of times and I feel she deserves an actual reward or treat of recognition 

Cheers in advance"
394,"Hi,

so there is ist this girl. Every time we meet, we have a lot to talk about. And in my opinion we see eye to eye at a lot of things and we have a lot in commen. And she is smliling and laughing and kinda have started to really like her and I think I might have a chance.

So the other day I've sent her a message on the phone and we started chatting. But she almost took half an hour for every reply. And because I've started to like her I'd really like to write always immediately?

Do u have any tips?

Thanks!"
395,About a month ago I had been looking through my husband phone at (I’m terrible I know) I went through his account on here and I had come across a message that he had sent to a user that will send pictures back to men and what not. Well the pictures that were sent were used with a imgur link which is unavailable now so I couldn’t see what picture he had sent to her. I really just don’t know how to feel about this I confronted him and he was obviously guilty sounding and somewhat defensive and I was unusually some what calm about the situation which is really strange to me. The whole situation does sting and I just don’t know what to do
396,"I (F44) have been married to my husband (M45) for almost 20 years. We’ve been having some rocky times in our relationship, and recently he’s been very angry at me because I’ve been out of work. 

I learned 10 days ago that my father died. I have been estranged from my family for 5+ years, and they didn’t let me know about his death until 2 days after it happened. If there was a funeral, I wasn’t invited, which is very hurtful. I’m angry of course, but I’m also grieving. 

My friends have been supportive, but my husband hasn’t been very empathetic. He says it’s because he’s working all the time to make up for the money that I’m not making. (He’s a bartender at a hotel downtown.) I feel that if I can’t lean on him during this difficult time, what are we even doing? Last night we had a pretty big fight, and I’m considering staying at a friends house for a couple of days. Is our marriage over?"
397,"I know the title doesn't make much sense. I'm Japanese-American and my boyfriend's Chinese-American, not that it really matters.

We had an argument last night because I was complaining about a white dude, probably in his 40s or so, that has repeatedly hit on me at the gym after I've told him to stop. This dude has made gross jokes about hentai and tentacle porn, and has asked me if I make ""Japanese sex noises"" or ""American sex noises"" in bed. He's also said he's never ""tried an Asian"" but heard it was good because the women ""let you do what you want more.""

This is far from the first time I've been hit with this kind of weird fetishization. Last year I was repeatedly harassed by a (yet again middle aged) white dude in a truck who drove by my regular evening running route. He would pull up and drive slowly next to me, saying things like, ""So this is how Asian chicks keep themselves stick-like,"" etc. He also, just from his appearance, seemed like the kinda dude that hits on Asian women much younger than him because he can't get someone his own age and because he wants to boss his girlfriend/wife around, have power over her, etc. One of my bosses also talks about his Asian wife in a kind of sexist, racist disparaging way that is constantly based on her Asian-ness.

Anyway I was complaining about this dude at the gym and also all the times in the past that this has happened to me, when all of a sudden my boyfriend tells me to ""Shut up about that kinda stuff--I get it, Asian girls are popular."" I was extremely pissed off that this was his takeaway from what I was saying, and we got into a huge argument over it. His thing is that it makes him insecure when his Asian girlfriends talk about white men and other type of people fetishizing them, because it's ""unfair"" since there's a stereotype about Asian men that they're unattractive to white girls.

Honestly, I'm baffled and extremely shocked that we even had this argument at all. How do I explain to him why it sucks that I can't complain about creepy things that happen to him on a regular basis without making him insecure? I'll clarify that I've never said anything to him ever that has implied that Asian men are unattractive in any way (in fact all my boyfriends have been Asian-American). Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing before? Is this the kind of thing that could be solved with a discussion?

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend gets insecure when I talk about white men fetishizing me, an Asian girl, because he feels unattractive as an Asian man in America. I kinda get what he's saying,. but don't know how to get past his anger and insecurity to try to explain my experience to him."
398,"I honestly feel like this is pretty much textbook ""rock and a hard place"" situation.  For background, we're currently attending out of state university.  He's been one of my good friends since freshman year.  We liked each other a lot initially, but I was Catholic at the time and he strongly atheist, so our feelings basically waned when we realized difference in religion was too big of an issue to make us compatible.

Fast forward to now, junior year.  I've since fallen out of Christianity, our feelings for each other came back, and we recently (3 weeks?) started dating.  This is where issue 1/2 arises: my parents would be SO UPSET.  I love them to death but they're incredibly intolerant and would be so angry at my choice of not only a passionately anti-religious man, but one that I'm sexually active with.

They would probably stop talking to me if they found out we've had \~premarital sex\~.  They'd definitely cut off contact from my little brother because I might be a ""bad influence.""  They did the same to my older sister a few years ago.  The fallout would be devastating.  My parents are certainly zealots in some ways but I love them completely and can't see a future in my life without them.

Issue 2/2 is the fact that our relationship has an expiration date: graduation.  He's of the ""it's better to have loved than lost than never to have loved at all"" view, where he wants to continue our relationship for the next year and a half so that we can be happy and then part ways amicably.  I, however, feel like it's better to just nip it at the bud rather than grow in our feelings because that will make the breakup so much harder.

So yeah.  Sorry for all the text.  We talked about it and he's crushed because he really likes me a lot.  It's been a really hard day for us because we're so sad.  I like him too but the guilt might be outweighing it.

Thanks for your help!  If you stuck it out this far you're a champ and i appreciate you :)

TL;DR I keep a secret boyfriend from my parents and the guilt of it is crushing me (telling them is not an option).  Also we're gonna have to break up a year and a half from now anyway so I'm not sure to stay or just break it off."
399,"For the longest time, I (F25) have always wanted children. I would fantasize about having children, the names I would give them, the activities we would do, family outings, etc. But within the last year, I’ve been having doubts for a few reasons.

- I’m not sure whether the desire to have children is my own or a product of cultural conditioning. My culture pushes having kids, continuing the family line, etc. Also, I live in the US where it’s odd if a woman doesn’t want to have children.

- I’ve never liked and/or understood children, and I’m specifically referring to kids in elementary school and younger. The first time I came in close contact with a baby, my first instinct was to let it sniff my hand. (No, I’m not kidding.) I wouldn’t know what to do if it started crying. I’ve never even held one before. And for toddlers, I just don’t understand how to interact with them. I understand that children have this “all about me” mentality and that everything is new and exciting to them but I don’t know how to respond to that. Maybe it’s just because I don’t understand them. 

- I recently became a full-time teacher and I truly do love teaching and have a passion for it. I mainly work with middle and high schoolers. Sometimes I feel like being a teacher fulfills my desire to have children, but then sometimes I feel that I want children of my own. I haven’t been teaching long enough to have a well-formed opinion on this though.

- I often worry that I'm not gonna be a good parent. My mom was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and blamed me for my dad's abuse towards her and my half-brother. Although I've long forgiven her, I still wish I didn't have to spend years healing from it. And in the case that I never heal, I'm afraid I'll end up the same way and project my issues onto my children. I would never forgive myself if I ever treated my children the way she treated me. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: I am nowhere near ready to have children (mentally and financially) so this is purely about the desire to have children."
400,"im not sure if this can be called assault because he is my boyfriend and i live with him, but a week ago i was trying to sleep and he was too turned on,i told him im very tired and didnt want anything right now. He completely ignored it and started touching me over and over and over again and undressing so i basically (very immature i know) started crying and told him no and then he slapped me and became very abusive and continued to do his thing. He has never been this way and im so scared he will continue. I love him and dont want to lose him but how do i approach this situation ? I can forgive him, this is a first for him however i just feel like i was violated. maybe he just had a tough day or maybe i wasnt giving him enough attention. Im open to any advice on what to do next."
401,"My friend and I have been close to each other for years. I’ve gone to her for advice on life and art ever since we were in Highschool together. She was the one who was with me during my darkest times and the one who has never left my side. She’s taken small breaks in the past and I’ve respected her space. But if I was ever in big trouble she would come through. In a way she’s been a mentor and my best friend.

But the last few months have been a bit weird as she has been getting personal with me. She’s told me about her family issues and other friends. She’s been coming to me for life advice. And even more, she’s been getting a lot more emotional with me. She is usually a very conserved person and has never come out to me about her problems. She comments on my pictures all of the time when she has never done that before. She texts me first actually way more than I do.

Another thing is she told me that she gets really cuddly and lonely when she is intoxicated. I told her that I’m a giddy person and get cuddly as well when I’m intoxicated. She then stated she would like to drink with me sometime. She’s even invited me over a couple of times to spend the night.

What I’m worried about is that she has feelings for me. Of course I love her to the world. I honestly can see myself living with her till the end. But I don’t want to ruin my friendship with her. She’s been everything to me and it helps me sleep at night knowing that she cares about me. She tells me all of the time she is proud of me. I know relationships can ruin the closest of friendships. How should I approach this?"
402,"I would describe myself as shy, geeky, into gaming but I dress well. I've not been with many guys since I was in long term relationships.

I started sharing with my housemate because we knew each other before and decided to move in together a few months ago. She used to model and is more confident and flirty. She claims to have slept with over a 200 guys and had a reputation in our circle. But she does have a long term partner now.

Problem is, naturally the guys I date will meet her when I bring them round to mine. We were never really close friends at all. But she meets them and loves bragging about things she does and becomes really flirty. I know half the stuff she says she does is BS but it's just her personality. But then I find that the guys seem more curious about her than getting to know me. I don't talk about it to them and just play it cool.

I'm ranting about her here but obviously I wouldn't bitch about her to them because that's not cool. It's little things like making me seem like the messy person when I'm the one constantly cleaning up after her And ask her to clear up stuff when no one is around. Guys would compare me to her and say how she eats healthy when I know half the time my food goes missing when she steals it.

I'd be lying if I said she wasn't prettier but then I imagined that I would have more of a connection with the guys I date over time and things like these wouldn't be an issue. I'm annoyed because I just want to know what to do....

Is moving out the only answer? But then there are women like her out there anyway right? Is it a sign I'm dating assholes?

Tl;Dr all the guys I bring home end up falling for my flirty housemate. What do I do?


Update: thanks for the comments everyone! I've got a plan to move out. I guess the silver lining is I get to filter out the guys who do encourage this sort of flirting but I'd rather not have to worry about these things in my own space!"
403,"Like, you have plans about the future and all that but the only way you communicate and be intimate for the mean time is through video chat. Would that still be considered a REAL legit connectiom/relationship?"
404,"I have been informed that my (49f) boyfriend (49m) has been cheating on me with 2 women individually. The women messaged me and he confirmed it. As I remember things, I think that this has been happening for most of our relationship, not with just these two, but various women. He has promised to be faithful only to me and had said that he cut ties with them. I have said that I will stay with him because we have a joint business venture. 
I have been faithful to him, take good care of him, and give him all the blow jobs and sex he wants. 
If you have been cheated on or were the cheater, was your relationship able to overcome the infidelity? I really want to make this work, but I’m not sure if it will"
405,"Hi! 

I was looking to get advice on something. Ive been with my boyfriend for a couple of years and the majority of the time we are happy and everything is good. I however have a very self destructive tendency that I need to stop but I dont seem to know how. 

Just a bit of a background I am a very anxious person, I worry about everything whether it be now or in the future and I overthink everything. 

My bf has no patience when it comes to petty arguments. But here is a cycle of what will happen. I will bring something up that I know will cause an argument, we will argue - he gets frustrated and will say some things I deem to be horrible (never anything untrue may I add) and then I will get upset but will keep pushing and then the argument ultimately ends when he feels so much guilt for making me upset (I do massively overplay on  this and say things I shouldnt) that he suggests that maybe we are better off apart. 

Now I don't want that but it has come to my realisation that I push the argument to this point. Its almost like if i push him away and argue with him so much that he should hate me but then if he chooses to be with me even after that I know he loves me, which is really messed up. 

Does anyone have any idea on why I do this and how I can stop!   


Thanks in advance!"
406,"He won’t meet me to talk in person, flips back and forth on wanting space or not, and is blaming me for everything and it is solely my fault. I know we’re both to blame but he is being unreasonable and I honestly tried everything to get him to talk.

I don’t even know if we’re still together cause he kept pushing me away and kept making break up threats and yet is still talking to me.

I don’t know where I stand with him, I am lost hurt and confused..."
407,"We're going away with a group of friends and we'll be skinny dipping, nude hot-tubbing etc. I think it'll be a great time since I'm not hung up on nudity and it would be fun to see everyone in their birthday suit. I'm just concerned because I have a small penis when soft (average when hard). I don't mind being seen but I hope my GF won't be uncomfortable.

She says she's totally cool with it - she obviously knows that I'm small when soft. However she's never seen me with the kind of extreme shrinkage I get whenever I'm nervous like at the doctors or I'm sure swimming naked with people. My penis can shrink to less than an inch - it almost retracts inside me. My GF has never seen me that small, more like a couple inches.

I'm concerned that once she sees me that small and sees her friends' reaction, she'll get turned off by me. The other guys will definitely have bigger penises. Her girl friends will find it pretty shocking how small I am and I'm sure they'll talk. I don't want to back out since I do think it'll be so fun, and being embarrassed about my size would be an even bigger turn off.

I just want advice on how to handle the situation so my GF doesn't get turned off by her friend's reaction. Or if it's possible that some girls, maybe her, actually enjoy having their BF get humbled by having his small penis exposed?"
408,"My boyfriend has always been insecure, telling me I’m cheating if I was late home or spamming me and my work with calls if I didn’t reply to a text in 10 min. We had our daughter at 21 and he tells everyone that I tricked him to become pregnant when in reality he told me he had too low a sperm count to get me pregnant.(naive, I know.) Throughout my pregnancy he threatened to leave 3-4 times a week and would tell me that the “thing” wasn’t his. I was very close to leaving and had packed up my stuff when he begged me to stay. I gave him one more chance and right up until our girl was 2 months old he was as perfect as when I fell for him. I regret this every day.

Recently it has been unbearable. He reads through every comment I make, every message I sent to family and every photo I have saved. He laughs at me for reading mummy forums, or the videos I like to watch. I feel humiliated and I am too embarrassed to do anything I like anymore because he is constantly looking over my shoulder degrading me in some form or another. Just tonight he hasn’t talked to me in over 18 hours because I told him I deserved privacy after he read through all my messages with my 80 year old grandmother. 

To list just some things he demands (my heart is racing and I can’t think straight enough to type this coherently):

-need to make an effort to shave , put on makeup and dress up when he comes home from work otherwise I don’t care about him 

-not allowed to have passwords he doesn’t know about (I have to save them all to shared google)

-not allowed to add people on social media without him checking

-if a man sends me a friend request he will not talk to me (must be cheating)

-I can’t reply to my brother or any other male (coworker , family) after 12am without him reading the messages

-I get the basics (food , shampoo , clothes) but nothing more. He spends close to 300 a week on luxuries for himself. He will bring up an expensive gift my family bought for my birthday in May if I ask for anything non essential.

-if ever I make a point that he can not argue, he will ignore me for days until I apologize and because he is the only person in my life (no friends and family is thousands of miles away) I always do

I never get compliments, he never takes photos of me and always has something to critique. He will never watch our daughter so I can shower or eat and tells me I am not a good mother and spoiling her for being unable to do those things with her in my arms. 

I was diagnosed with PPD when our baby was 3 months. It has been awful and I feel so disconnected and tired all the time. He told me he would stop loving me if I took my prescribed medicine as it would “ruin my personality” and make me fatter. i have had to lie to my doctor about taking it since. He also told me to refuse therapy because “what have you been telling them? You are not that depressed”

He goes on my phone and deletes all arguments where he is obviously cruel. He has told me every time we argue that if I leave him, he will win full custody as I am mentally unstable and don’t love our daughter which he can “prove” in screenshots where I opened up to him about my PPD thinking he would support me. I have no proof of how he treats me. He has all passwords to all my social media and phone and laptop and I have nothing of his. I  am making this post from a private tab on my phone while he’s asleep in absolute panic of how long i would go without seeing my daughter if he knew.

I don’t know what to do. He has punched holes in the walls but I believe him when I say he wouldn’t physically hurt anyone. My only fear keeping me with him is losing my baby. I cannot do this anymore but I feel so helpless and hurt and alone. I just need advice. Thank you"
409,"Recently I have been the advisor to two of my brothers-in-law, one more so than the other as the other now has a girlfriend (with help from my advice).

The other BIL is now friends with benefits with someone from his work who liked him for ages then supposedly moved on... They agreed before hand that it would just be two friends having fun. They got to third base stuff the other day but she has already suggested he comes round again as she has a free house.

I advised him that she may have agreed that it's just fun but she's hoping that he will change his mind. She knows that he currently likes someone else and is okay with that but I still think she's not over him and will hope that this will change his mind.

Was I right in my advice or has anyone in the girls situation had it where it was just fun?"
410,"He is literally always sleeping. He works maybe 10 hours a day, gets home and sleeps, often through the whole night until the morning. So when I get home a couple hours after him, he is already sleeping and we don’t spend time together. He will sleep through the whole weekend if he can. He will even sleep through work days. We just moved into an apartment together and I’m so worried because he is making double the amount that I make so he is taking care of most of the rent, but he was almost fired for missing so many days already. 

He refuses to take any medication or go see a doctor, or even talk to someone. 

The nights that he does stay up with me, he will be watching videos very very late at night and often wakes me up. I can’t miss any day at work because I need to pay the bills and put food on the table. 

We have been together over a year and he lost his previous job at the beginning of our relationship and would sleep all day, I wouldn’t hear from him. 

He never comes to my family events (which isn’t a lot) because he says he feels sick or he is tired all the time. I think he has come maybe twice the whole time we’ve been together. 

Lately he has started calling me names and getting mad about me trying to explain that he can’t just sleep all the time and let me do the clean up (he’s very messy). 

I don’t know what to do, I’m stuck in this lease with him for a long time and I don’t know if I can do it. It’s becoming unbearable. We are in Canada. Any advice would be appreciated."
411,"Me and my boyfriend are both 32 years old. We've been together for over a year. Honestly things went pretty fast with us. We have a son now that's 4 months old. We live together and both of us work a lot. All of the struggles and things we've went through together so far hasn't even come close to messing up our relationship. We do love each other. The only real relationship he's been in before me lasted 10 years. I've been in one as well in the past that was on and off for about 15 years. I've been cheated on by my ex too many times to count. I'm glad I found the one I'm with now and I honestly see a future with him. His ex cheated on him and even left him for the guy she cheated with. Now from my understanding this girl did a lot to hurt him over the course of their relationship. She's had abortions, constantly accused him of cheating on her even with her friends, everytime he proposed to her she turned it down, etc..... So with all that being said, when we first got together I told him I did want to eventually get married someday. Not anytime soon of course because we still have plans and things we want to do like moving and getting settled down in another town away from where we are. I explained to him that this is something I want in my future. I love the idea of marriage and being connected to someone in that way. I've thought about it even more since we've had our son. I love this man so much. The few times I've brought it up he says that marriage isn't what it used to be and he doesn't want to get married, ever. He doesn't believe in it and all that. I would believe him and try to accept his decision even though it's not what I want, but considering he's supposedly asked his ex more than once to marry him and she kept rejecting it, obviously he does or has liked the idea of it before. Everytime I think about it it bothers me and not long ago I asked him if his ex had anything to do with why he'll never consider marriage again and he said that was part of it. That makes me wonder if he's even really 100% over his ex. Also, I feel like I'm being punished in a way because he's letting what happened between them years ago affect our relationship and future. I'm just at a loss now and I'm not sure what to do or say anymore. I really don't understand why he lets his old relationship interfere with us. It seems like it is to me anyway. I guess I'm just looking for advise and if anyone's had a similar situation before....."
412,"So basically today I woke up and texted “good morning baby” to my gf and she replied with “Gm”. I Figured she’s in a bad mood as usual and I was having a busy day at work so I didn’t want to reply right. She texted me saying how cold I am and she called me but my phone was on silent and I didn’t hear it so I didn’t answer. I explained that I was busy at work and I called her and everything was fine. However, right now she’s not replying to my texts. I don’t think she’s giving me the silent treatment or even mad but she just doesn’t want to reply. What does this mean? She told me two days ago that she’s stressed and she needed space to think of her issues and we talked about it so it’s not like I’m not being caring or anything. I know “what’s wrong” with her but I didn’t have the energy to double text today."
413,"
Everything seemed to be going well. We went to one of her family members weddings and thing went well. She even sent pictures of us to my mom. Anyways not even a week later she had a break down and said she doesn't know if she wants to break up or take a break. I made her give me an answer a couple days later. She wanted a brake. She told me how could I love you if I don't love my self? 

I'm lost and confused. The last couple days have been rough. She says thinga like you're my best friend and then goes on to say i feel like we have to tip toe around each other in the house. Anyway i got tired of her mixed signals and packed my bags and left. I left her love letters she wrote me and anything she gave me. She told me I didn't have to go and the house will never be the same but never actually told me to stay.

What's going on with her? Why did she do this? Was me leaving the right decision? How should I proceed with all of this? I'm extremly lost and heart broken and don't know what to do.

Tl;dr Girlfriend wanted a break for no real reason. What do I do?"
414,"[TL;DR] I'm starting to catch feelings for a guy I met to just get physical with. I told him, he said he 'liked' me too beyond the physical part, but I'm not sure if he fully understand because I don't think he acts like it, but maybe i'm just overthinking. I want to know if I should pursue this and what it is I should do to make this work.

A couple of months ago I (24M) met a guy (21M) on a website obviously used for gay guys to have physical adventures. (Which is no big deal in my country.) We met the same day and had a fun time. That's it. After that we texted about that one time and we tried to meet up again. In this period of time he would text me once in a while if he would be in the mood. If I would be busy he would make clear that he was expecting my attention. 

A couple of weeks ago we met for the second time in his neighborhood. I volunteered to drive for 1,5 hours to see him. This time, we started by talking. When he told me about him I really started to admire things about him. We had our adventure afterwards and when we were done I asked if he had plans, it was around midnight. He said he didn't so I proposed to just keep hanging for a bit. He gave me a kiss on the cheek and hugged me and then the physical part was over and we just kept talking simple stuff. After less than an hour he said he should get going and at that exact moment I felt like we had this connection that I really wanted to keep. 

When I got on my way home I couldn't get him of my mind. I really liked him as a person because of the talk we had not just his body anymore. When I got home I texted him and told him I enjoyed his company and that I also liked him beyond the physical part. He said he did too. From that moment on I feel like I creeped him out, but i'm not sure if i'm just overthinking. Since then, he never texts first and he seems busy all the time. Which, don't get me wrong, I don't blame him.

That second time he told me he was moving abroad on his own for a prestigious university. I jokingly said I didn't like that idea. He said he would visit home once in a while. When I said I imagined he would have more important stuff to do than meet me, he said he didn't. So before he went, I sent him 'the long text'. In short, I told him I was thinking about him from time to time and that I would like to keep talking to him and keep seeing him when possible. I asked if that would be annoying or creepy as he was starting a new phase in his life, he said he liked that idea, but could not guarantee regular visits. I told him  that I didn't expect him to, but that I just feel this urge to talk to him or be in his company.

Since a couple of weeks he is abroad. Sometimes when I text him, which isn't a lot because I really try to hold back, he seems cold and short (and a day late) but sometimes he is showing interest. Don't get me wrong, he is always very friendly. In those conversations I have also made subtle hints that I want him.

So now i'm wondering if he's just being friendly or if he understood me when I said I liked him more than just his body. I'm not sure if I should be the adult one and text him all of this and ask how he feels because i'm scared to creep him out as we've only seen each other two times and I don't want to bother him as I really imagine he is getting settled. Sometimes I wonder if it would be better to just hold back, go with the flow and see what the future holds. I really feel like I don't want to 'lose' him while I actually don't even really got to know him that well. I'm afraid that all of this will just fade away if I don't make a move or be clear to him. I absolutely don't want him to change anything about the circumstances of his situation. If only I would hear him say he feels the same, I would be happy.

What should I do to make this work?

415,"I do makeup professionally and I had a new eyeliner I wanted to try, it’s different doing on yourself then someone else so I asked my son if I could put a little on him. He said yes. It was only a tiny bit, it was barely anything. He was giggling the whole time. 

My husband came home, and he came into our bedroom, my son was lying in bed watching tv. When he saw his face he asked him, “what’s on your face?”. And then he asked me, “did you do this?”. I just nodded. I could see that he was angry so I told him “relax honey it’s nothing”. He told our son to go wash his face, and when he walked away my husband came over to me and pressed me against the wall. He asked me if I wanted his son into a faggot. He wasn’t raising his voice, he was calm but he was just looking at me with a lot of hatred. I told him “no” and “I’m sorry”. He put his hand on my face and told me “I don’t want to see something like that again, do you understand me?”. I said yes and then kissed me and walked away.

This was hours ago, and the rest of the night has been peaceful. My husband is still a little cold towards me, but it’s been fine. I knew he may not like it, but I didn’t expect him home so early. I just feel uneasy. I want my husband to understand that if our son is gay that couldn’t have been changed. I don’t see the makeup as wrong, but maybe it is. I want to say something to my husband, but I am not sure how. It’s just I don’t want him pushing any toxic beliefs on our son in the future. How can I talk to him about this? What should I say? I don’t like to see him upset but it was really nothing, in my mind."
416,"A lot has happened over this past week and I don't know wtf my life is anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

After our fight I asked for some time to cool off and he agreed. We spent the last few days not really talking, just the occasional text to see how the other was. I then decided I'd had enough time to think and I came to the conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

He needs to let me know what is in the email or I can't trust him again, if it is porn or something like that then I don't mind, even I watch porn! but I have to know, for my sanity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I texted him yesterday and told him that and he took a while to respond but eventually agreed but he said he didn't want to be there when I looked through it. He sent me through the email (which was exactly what I remembered, female firstname.lastname so I wasn't crazy like he said). I logged in an opened it up and looked through some of the emails and its just really weird stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if it's porn or not. It's full of emails about being a woman and acting like one and beauty tips and stuff with instructions but its all really homoerotic or just normal erotic cause I don't get it. There were order confirmations for womens clothes and shoes and stuff and some sex toys. I opened up one of the google docs and it was full of this kinda thing. Pages of instructions and lessons (?). I really don't know what to make of it.  ngl I teared up a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered something a few comments mentioned about him maybe being trans and I texted him asking him if he was and that he could be honest with me, he texted immediately saying no but that could just mean he is in denial. I asked him if he was gay or bi and he said no, even when I told him I didn't mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told him we need some space and kinda broke up with him because this is too much, but I don't know what to make of it. I really do like him and before now would have even said I truly loved him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should talk to him in person or just leave it the way it is and move on? So I've turned once more to internet strangers for their unvarnished viewpoint."
417,"I want to emphasize that we have a good relationship outside of this problem.

Basically she is more emotional than me by quite a bit and her reactions can make me stressed. When she gets upset she defaults to anger while I respond with sadness. Before especially, she was quick to yell, cuss, etc. Meanwhile I like to talk calmly and solve the problem. After repeated arguments about boundaries she has mostly stopped yelling and cussing.

The next thing was on running away during disagreements. She tended to run off when upset, grab her keys and leave, slam doors... I can understand this kind of reaction if something horrible happened (ex. cheating) but for a normal disagreement I think it’s too much. I was many times put in situations where I had to chase her, try to convince her not to go, etc. One time I finally let her go and she called me asking why I hadn’t chased her and if I was driving to get her back from her parents’ house. I said I was sick of this and this has pretty much completely stopped for months.
I have noticed that she has made a big effort to change in this areas. We made a system where I said if she needs space she can just let me know and we can talk later when she’s ready. 

But recently she said that I am stifling her personality and reactions. She said that talking calmly is “my way” and getting upset is “her way” and that I’m not letting her be herself. I was very sad about this and wondered if the improvement I thought we made wasn’t real. I told her that if she really thinks this is an authoritarian thing then she should leave me. 

She told me to stop being ridiculous and said all she wanted was a compromise. She said she is trying her best to not overreact and knows she is difficult but that sometimes she wants to be chased, and sometimes she can’t help but run away and get upset. She said she wants to know I will “make the effort” to do this for her as she has made the effort to sit down calmly as I asked. 

I feel kind of uneasy about this. Could I have some advice?

—-

TLDR: Gf told me that sometimes she wants to be chased and that running away and getting upset is who she is. She wants to know that I’ll make the effort to chase her. I want to be fair"
418,"If they ask me what I do for work either I could say “I don’t want to talk about it” or I could make something up that is neutral that fits in better. Something like “I do IT at a local mid-size company”.

I want advice on whether this is a good idea or not. If it’s not a good idea, why isn’t it?"
419,"I've been with my beautiful girlfriend for nearly 3 years now, she's really the absolute best thing that's ever happened to me and I appreciate and love her so very much. Around the same time that I got with her, I was going through an extremely bad crisis with anxiety and major depression in my life, and it really impacted our relationship. I'm always overthinking and questioning myself irrational things like:

What if she doesn’t love me as much as I love her?

What if she’s lying to me?

What if she’s hiding something from me?

What if she’s cheating on me?

What if she wants to cheat on me?

What if she likes someone else better?

What if my anxiety ruins our relationship? (anxiety about the anxiety)

What if we break up?

What if she doesn’t text me back?

What if I’m always the first one to reach out?

What if she ghosts on me?

These are only a few of the type of questions constantly running through my mind, we're very open about these irrational thoughts but they happen so often and I'm so terrible at controlling them that it's getting to a point where it's now beginning to affect our relationship. My girlfriend says she's constantly having to reassure me and that I should be working on reassuring myself and learning to overcome these thoughts and insecurities on my own, and I believe she's right. It's time I own up to my anxiety and begin the process of learning to trust her and eliminate these irrational thoughts of mine. I want to be able to finally go a day without having to be anxious about something, I want to give her the absolute best version of myself. If anybody has any advice or tips you can give me, I'd appreciate it so very much, I'm open to hearing from anyone, thank you all."
420,"It's been 9 weeks since I broke up with my long-term partner, we were together 15 years and I have two beautiful children 10 and 8. What advice can people give me which can ease the pain and hurt of this break up."
421,"So me and my GF have been in a LDR for 6 Months(only 2 Hour drive) and finally got to meet each other last week for 3 Days(Took us so long because we wanted our first visiting to be alone without someones parents being there and after that we could meet each other every weekend, so not that bad. We had such a good connection and compatibility, we talked everyday on the phone for at least 4 hours and up to 10 without getting bored, we also texted a lot. She said so many things about her feelings like how im the first one who she truely loves, how happy i make her, howmuch she loves me, how i am the perfect boyfriend she always imagined having and how other couples would be jealous of us, also making me cute little texts and gifts, talked about our future and what we would do at our visitings and all of that jazz. We talked about our first visiting and what we would do, we talked a lot about sex and what we would do since she is a virigin and i wanted to make it special for her and so on.   

We both meet each other, kissed, we were in the city first and walked around for hours and just talked, it felt right like it wasthe 1000th time we met each other and not awkward or anything so i was realy happy. We went shopping and first thing we did at her home was that we cooked and watched a movie at her couch &amp; after the eating i wanted to make a move on her, but she seemed very distant and sat at one end of the coach &amp; i was in the middle so there was a bit space between us and i think both were a bit shy, we talked a bit but not a lot &amp; her dog went into that space and i thought okay ill make a move when we are at her bedroom, so it was late and i asked her if she wanted to sleep or go up her room, she then told me her dog will probably cry all night(wich is true) and we should sleep on the coach, now everything was ruined from that point since i didnt know what to do so i just continued the 2 days not beign intimate (not even cuddling or kissing or holding hands or anything). We still talked like we did on the phone just less because all we did was watch movies or walk with her dog.   

Now after the visiting was over  i text her ""okay that was different then expected, felt more like we were friends without all the things we talked about, but it was probably because it was our first time seeing each other, next week it will be better &lt;3"" and she didnt reply for hours, until i get a text that there will be no next time and she wants to break up because we planned all the things and i didnt do any of it, and that it felt like we were friends and thats how she feels towards me now, just a friend and not a romantic partner.    

Despite the 6 months her telling me howmuch she loves me, i meet her one day and we didnt do anything intimate and she instantly loses all her feelings, should i even try anymore or move on? im so devistated i cant think straight"
422,"There’s a bit of a situation here.

I moved to a new city and am renting a room from a guy (Kyle) from my hometown. I’ve been here for 2 months and during that time have gone on many dates from people I’ve met on bumble. Ive been on a number of dates with Steve and have been taking to Taylor for a while too but we haven’t met yet. 

Out of nowhere Kyle asked me to go out on a Friday night. We had dinner and drinks, talked until 3am and sat on opposite sides of the couch. That weekend (thanksgiving) one thing led to another and we slept together. We have an incredible connection and I adore the way he treats and looks at me. He’s a gentleman, has a stable career, puts his hand on my knee, carries me home and doesn’t expect anything in return. He’s a homeowner and so so thoughtful.

He’s 30 and wants kids like tomorrow. I’m not sure what I want. I adore the outdoors and want someone to take me out camping, fishing etc. I understand my girlfriends can do this but I enjoy when a man can take care of me and take the lead on those things. Kyle doesn’t enjoy the outdoors. Told me he won’t take me fishing. He’s very careful. He would rather stay at an all inclusive hotel then rent a car and see the city. He doesn’t do things off the beaten path. I’m all about winging it, adventure and excitement. I haven’t had a boyfriend before and know that’s what Kyle wants, if not more. It scares me. It scares me knowing that him and I could be absolutely perfect for each other but I’m putting the fact that I want adventure and excitement to the side. 

Kyle is safe. Kyle is everything I want in terms of a boyfriend to treat me right. He’s a giver and would do anything for me. He’s a god damn sweetheart. He drove me to the airport at 2am because he didn’t want me to worry about things.

The issue is we live together as roommates and I want to still talk to Steve and Taylor to see if we can go on adventures together: I know this will hurt Kyle a lot. 

Kyle has made it very clear he’s not seeing anyone else. Kyle and I FaceTime daily (I’m on vacation right now) and he even tells me about his daily plans to the point to mention who he’s with. 

I’m torn between having the conversation with him of how I was very independent before I met him and that I’m struggling to give him my 100%. I haven’t weeded out the other men. It’s not fair to myself for dismissing them when I found them interesting even thought I do feel a strong connection with Kyle.

I haven’t been in this problem before. I’m usually the type to only date one person at once and I think I’m acting out because the one man I had strong feelings before I moved here doesn’t want to be involved with me. 

Please inbox me because im struggling with this 

**TL;DR torn between making new guy my 100% and telling him I still want to date other people because it happened so suddenly. We are roommates**"

So here's the dilemma. My mom INSISTS that above all, the absolute most important thing about whoever I decide to ultimately marry is that they're Jewish. Now I keep kosher, I had a bar mitzvah, I speak a little bit of Hebrew, I think Israel is an awesome country (in terms of their technological superiority at least...), but I don't really consider myself as ""very Jewish"". My mom has made the argument that I should marry someone Jewish because it gives like... a sense of connectedness to God or something like that? I don't really know. But she started talking about all this because I have a girlfriend who comes from a totally different background than I do. I'm upper class, she's middle class. She has good ambitions, she wants to join the national guard and eventually be a medic or something like that in the military. She has a job, she's beautiful, we have very very very compatible personalities. However, despite her very limited flaws and our amazing connection, my mom still thinks that I'll have problems later in life if I decide to marry her, just because she isn't Jewish... somehow.

So what I'm kind of asking for is this: People who married someone very different from them in background, or that their parents didn't approve of, or maybe even someone who wasn't Jewish when you were... how did that turn out?"
424,"Not sure this is the right sub buuuuuuut

Been carpooling into work with my co worker, who I would consider a friend at this point, for about a month and a half now since he got moved to my shift. We both live about an hour/50 miles from work, so it makes sense to save gas money. Only now, I am not wanting to carpool anymore. I want to go to the gym right after work, because by the time we get back near home, I am worn out from the day (up at 5am, and dont get back home until after 8pm). So id rather go right after work, then make the hour long drive home and go right to bed pretty much. I have brought up going to the gym together after work, but he goes in the morning before and I have other obligations before work that I cant change.

Secondly, I am a pretty big introvert, and I really need my alone time. I used to drive in myself every day, and I really enjoyed it because I had an hour before and after work (10 hour shifts) to kind of prepare (I am NOT a morning person at all) or de-compress from the day. I like working with the guy, I enjoy it, but im already around him for 10+ hours a day as it is, id rather have those other 2 hours to myself. 

How do I bring this up nicely? Like I said I consider him a friend and I also still have to work long shifts every day with him, so I dont want to be mean about it. Cant think of a way to come up with it without being rude."
425,"I want to start by saying yes I know it was wrong to look through his phone and is a violation of privacy, I normally wouldn’t but I was sensing he wasn’t happy/ satisfied anymore. (Also he has looked through mine in the past - not that that makes it right for me to do it) 

So he was talking to his friend through text and said “man fat asses make me melt. __’s ass got fatter over our relationship but it’s just not the same as those oversized throw pillows. Lmfao cut the titties off and n put it in the ass. I could have a a flat chested girl if she had all the ass in the world.”  (side note if you didn’t gather I have really big boobs and a plump but def not huge butt) 

Then the friend said he saw a Jessica lookalike at work (Jessica is a girl my bf briefly/ almost had a thing with before we dated). So my bf said “man I miss Jessica’s booty. She’ll hit me up once in a while but I have to keep it insignificant lmao”  then he talked about some girl at work he vibes with really well and misses when she’s not at work, sounds like he has a crush on her although he didn’t say that flat out. 

So I’m just really torn.  I love him to death we’ve been dating four years, we moved across the country together and I don’t want to break up with him, but at the same time I don’t think I can feel sexy or confident in bed anymore. I know it’s normal as human beings to be attracted to other people, but I wish it didn’t have to be said in such a degrading way. Is this just normal guy talk for men in relationships? He hasn’t cheated, so am I overreacting? Appreciate the help.

Edit: Thank you everyone for taking the time to hear me out and offer advice, it really means a lot to me that anonymous people care so much! I told him I saw the texts and at first he got really angry and defensive, then closed up and ashamed. Then later he cried and said he didn’t mean it at all and was just high and stupid, and he’s sorry if he hurt me or disrespected me. He definitely feels awful and guilty about it. But now still figuring out what it is I want/need to do. I feel like I’ll always be worrying that he will be lying to me and just saying what I want to hear rather than being honest. I’m worried his true self is that immature boy in those texts. He definitely has two sides to him and it’s confusing."
426,"It just want the pain to stop. After 7 months he comes back and tells me we could do it again and that he wanted me in his life.
And then he leaves again. Just like that. I was nothing again. Nothing to him. My heart hearts again. I just want it to stop."
427,"Me and this girl broke up over two years ago and all of our pictures are still on her account. I have since gotten another girlfriend and although I never speak to this girl anymore I don’t believe she’s dating anybody. Is there a reason why she would do this?

I’ve asked her multiple times over the years to take them down because it’s just odd to have pictures with your ex on social media these days. She doesn’t respond and nothing has changed.

Part of it may be that I was much more attractive than she was and she’s using pictures with me as bragging rights, or trying to just irritate me, I have no clue. I don’t mean to sound like a narcissist, but she was not that good looking.

Would it be worth it to contact instagram support about it? I haven’t done that yet.

What do I do?"
428,"So my girlfriend and I met in highschool. We've dated for nearly 2 years now and are coming up on our next year of college. She was anxious at first, but I encouraged and supported her in joining clubs and activities, and was so happy when she finally settled in and started having fun and letting herself relax around people! We see each other about once or twice every other week, and im starting to feel scared that I'm not doing enough for her to stay interested in me. 
Shes having kind of a rough time getting used to college, and shes been seeing a therapist and discussing emotional issues that have been looming over her for her whole life, and subsequently shes been feeling down and exhausted from this, understandably. She's met a lot of friends through college, but one of her male friends has done a lot and taught her a lot of things, hes taken her to his hometown to to shooting, taught her how to drive a manual car, shared his games with her and is in one of the clubs she is in-- and I trust she sees him as only friends, and I'm in no way worried about any sort of cheating, but I just feel like I cant do enough with her in such a little amount of time to even compare to what they do there. Usually when we see each other I only have enough time to catch up with her, take her out to eat or to do something fun, and watch a movie or play games, but I just feel like I cant compare to the people shes met because of how little time we get together as a couple.. I'm trying to plan trips and small vacations, and trying to get her to expereince new things as a couple and as a fun way of bonding, but no matter what I do I just feel like it's never enough to make up for the lost time, the lost emotional support, and the lost experiences we could have had as a couple :( she says I'm doing a great job and that I'm a wonderful boyfriend, but I just can't help the feeling that I'll slowly be less and less interesting to her as time goes on, and it scares me because I honest to god feel that shes the one for me. Even in this little time of 2 years, our relationship has been a breeze, random spontaneous gifts, happy meetups, barely any arguments or fights, learning and doing new things, all two years completely filled with love and support for each other- everything just sort of works, and im completely head over heels for her. I just feel so terrified of losing her.. 

Tl;dr: I'm scared my little every other week visits to my girlfriend in college will eventually be less interesting for her, and I'm scared I'll lose the love of my life"
429,"I hear a lot of stories how cheating ruined a relationship ( for obvi reasons). But has it ever helped a relationship? Regardless of your SO finding out, did being with someone new help you realize you dont want that?"
430,I’ve been through heartbreak before but this is a bit different for me because he was my best guy friend for 3 years and bf for around 6 months. He recently broke up with me because “he’s not ready for a relationship” but really it’s more like his work and family is stressing him out so he can’t handle the responsibilities of a relationship right now. He still wants us to be best friends but I dunno if I can do that anymore. I’m not sure what to do.
431,"My 22M boyfriend still sleeps with a pillow pet his ex gave him 6 years ago, and also cuddles with a stuffed animal hes had since he was 10... is this weird or am I overthinking it?"
432,"So tell me what you guys think of this because I am a bit confused on the situation and am beating myself up sometimes. So I dated this girl for about a year and we broke up one time like four months in. She said I gave her rapey actions , but in my option I didn't think so. Is grabbing your gf but in bed rapey? Anyways we broke up then I proceeded to apologize because I felt like a piece a shit. I was a little drunk so maybe I did something but deep down I believe I didn't. I just didn't want to lose her. we get back together the next week after me chasing and go snowboarding with my friends that weekend. I ended up looking taking her camera to take a picture of of all of us but when I saw the camera the most recent picture on the camera was of her and her ex boyfriend. I dumped her on the spot and enjoy a 2 hour car ride home. when I get home she ask to talk I said sure but you better come before 9. in my perspective I was being a asshole to see if she cared . she didn't respond until next day telling me to delete her nudes and get her stuff back. I forgave her and tried to be reasonable with the situation because she comes from a hard family and eventually ended up apologizing. That ruined the trust in a aspect. The next few months we were with each other non stop but I always had a gut feeling something wasn't right. I asked her friends about some people she was snap chatting and turns out she has been talking to  a bunch of people who she has sent nudes to and dated in the past. We had a long talk and she gave me a hand written letter that seemed sincere so I gave her another chance. At the time I transferred schools and didn't know much people so I was pretty lonely.Months later  she talked me to going to a summer camp with her for the summer and I Agreed. She left 3 week before I was gonna show up and we limited contact thru FaceTime and texting. One of the nights I suspected her of lying about what she was doing but didn't say anything. Next phone call I was drunk and called her out of her past behavior and why I didn't trust her. We ended the phone then tried to call her back realizing I was being a dick. She didn't pick up so I dumped her thru text. Next day we talk on the phone she says how much she loves me and wants to be in a committed relationship and that should would leave to come back. We made up but I was a bit mad that she didn't respond of that night. That was a big reason why I broke up with her. Next day she texts me she doesn't want to be with me. I freak out telling her that I didn't mean what I said. no response. the day after that was the day I left for camp. I arrived at the camp late and see her talking to someone. I wait to approach and when I say hi she gives me this frantic look. Have you ever dated someone or known someone to know they quirks to know that something is not right? any ways she says we should talk tomorrow. that night I went to the bar, the only local bar in town which is 30 mins away from camp and I see her there playing pool with some guy. I ignore her for an  hour or two because I thought space would be good but I caved and eventually went to talk to her. She gave me a ignorance response as in you aren't shit you don't deserve my attention why am I talking to you almost like the past year didn't happen. I stoped trying and just socialized with my new friends . I accidentally brought alchol outside and got kicked out the bar. so when I was sitting there I ended up calling her a bunch. I was drunk and moody ill be honest. She didn't respond so I called familiy members to ask for advice. When I left the bar bars with my buddies I see her at the staff lounge. Don't say a word to her. Went to my cabin to drop some stuff off then went back but on the way I see those too walking back and I hit her with you still mad at me? She didn't respond. I was at the staff lounge for a minute or two resizing I don't know anyone there and people I have met are gone so I come back down and end up seeing them again and I say I know you still love me talk to me when you're aren't mad. At that time I was very emotional. I just had a huge conflict with my roommates where they ripped me off on rent, my dad told me he is depressed has anxiety and is now raising a new family I didn't know about and I was having a bad year of college on the fence of flunking out. I went to the lake to clear my mind and went to get water a few times. One of the times I went I hear someone say hey you want to join us. I asked who it ws and he gave me his name. I looked closer to see  the clothing of the guy and it was the guy my ex was with. We end up talking and he says to me that I am scaring her falling her around and that I was waiting outside the bar for her. I snapped at that moment because I knew for a fact I wasn't. I proceeded to tell this guy he doesn't know anything about her, call him a bitch, tell him to say this to my face when I am sober. He told me to realize my actions that I could get out. I told them that im sorry I shouldn't be freaking out. Then he proceeds to say more bullshit. I try to ask my ex in subtle ways like are serious. She said I need more time to give you an answer. Keep in mind we made up on the phone when she was cri=ying saying how much she loves me. At the point my anger ass says you know what you two do whatever the fuck you want to do. Next day I talk to the councilor. He tells me that her and someone said I was making her uncomfortable at the camp stalking her, but said he would monitor my behavior. Keep this part in mind. Next 8 days I try to talk to her to see wtf is going on but she ignores me and gives me disrespectful responses. Finally when she is not with the guy she talks to me and says that we should take this as a learning lesson. I proceeded to tell her why I did the thing I did and the situation I was in and her response was im just so mad right now I just want to hit you. I was so confused. Was I the bad person or her. Anyway after that I left her a handwritten message. no response. So I texted her the day after calling her out on her behavior and saying that she always pushes me away when she think she is about to be abandoned. I think I was just oblivious and she deceived me from before. But I got no response and on my way to the lounge I see them pass by. Thats when I knew that this girl Is full of shit. I didn't end up talking to her for two months at the camp. keep in mind I saw her and the other guy almost everyday. This guy would stare at me to almost like a intimidation. At first I was jealous but after like 2-3 weeks I realized that what she put me thru is absolutely bullshit. I felt manipulated and lied to . I remember thinking to myself and saying karmas got my back. Once I stopped giving a shit so I didn't look at her or care wtf she did I noticed something funny. I caught her staring at me in anger when I was happy or staring at me when I wasn't looking and always tried to be around this guy around me to provoke a reaction. It was almost like she was trying to hard if that makes sense. Anyways it didn't work so I think she switched her strategy. I wearing a specific shirt then she would wear the same one later that day. Keep in mind this the shirt my mom. gave both of us. Then when should would walk past me she would walk directly in my path strait in a way where I had to like turn my shoulder and maneuver. Eventually I heard she had the worst camp rating score in her department and the guy she ended fucking tore all the ligaments in his foot. Someone came up to me saying that man you dodge a bullet that guy lies so damn much I worked with her before. This came from someone I didn't even know.  As the end of camp approaches I come and talk to her for the first time in 2 months. I told her didn't hate her and she responded fast and harsh with a I don't hate you I just don't care. I proceeded to say I we should've broken a while ago and that im just hear to ask for the money you owe me. I stuck around for a brief moment and she said what are you still doing here in a very hostile rude manner and I said Im just thinking if there is anything else to say then said I think that was everything and said it was fun while it lasted. Haven't spoken since its been months but I can't stop thinking if It my personal problem or something else. I like to work on things to improve personally but I feel like I was so manipulated that I don't know what exactly was the context. Please let me know thanks. Btw I asked for the money early on and she said she would give it to me but never did. She would stare a lot at me when I wasn't looking and tried to trash my reputation after I didn't get kicked out. I know this for a fact after asking some people from camp and they told me the story of what they said and it is a damn lie. Also at last conversation I asked what she said to the director and she said that he gave her the option to let me stay or leave and she said stay. But I think thats a lie because she doesn't know that I know that the guy she ended hooking up with all camp and went to the director together . Ive heard so many perspectives that say im in the right that she is wrong but sometimes I feel it is biased because of face to face communication. Give me your real opinion. I would never get back this girl but want to know my own flaws to learn from the situation."
433,"Okay so a weird situation here. I really need advice on what to do.

So I’ve been friends with this girl from around a year and best friends for about 6 months. 

So I asked her for a date about 5 months ago and she declined and we were okay with it and I was almost over it but last week she told me she had developed feelings for me. 

We decided that we should try dating. 

4 days ago the first date went really great and we were holding hands and not leaving each other by the end of it. 2nd date was the next day itself and we started discussing future with each other even as far as marriage. We were flirting on text and she acted like (atleast I think) that she likes me a lot and she even admitted that her feelings had increased.

Now yesterday evening we were just hanging out casually and she was acting weird but it was still romantic. She refused to tell me what was going on. But then after asking twice she said she felt like she has lost romantic feelings for me but she still thinks we’re worth it. But then she looked at me when I became really sad and she later called me to tell me we should stop dating and said “I don’t want to hurt you. My confusion shouldn’t hurt you”. 

Now later she acted like she was just normal. And that things are normal and that I should just forget it all. 

I don’t know what to do.

Somehow by dating my crush has become ‘love’ and I’ve been freaking out and crying the whole night because I really felt this was going to be the one. 

I’m gonna meet her today but I don’t know what to talk about.

Please any help would be appreciated."
434,"I've been in a bad relationship for almost 3 years. A lot of things happens and I feel I can't be myself anymore. I don't go over the details right now, I just know in my head that this relationship is long overdue and I know I have to breakup for myself.  


But though I know what I need I can't seem to do it. Every time when she almost breaks up or that I try to break up, I start to save the unsaveable relationship that I'm in. I start to excuse myself and say sorry all the time. I even lie to try to save something I don't really want saving. I'm devastated... What can I do?"
435,"So let me first give some background on my love life:
I have been looking for a relationship since I hit puberty (which was not kind to me) - I am the type of guy that becomes overly excited over anything small, so a simple ""miss you x"" heightens my expectations to believe that some long-term relationship is underway. I do tend to overthink things.

Girl (1) [24/F] is, simply put, amazing, I met her over a year ago and we've slept with each other quite a few times since then. We live like 1600km (1000 miles) apart. End of 2018 I told her I had feelings for her, her reply was ""I'm not looking for a relationship now"".
Fast-forward to April this year where I had a long, honest chat with her essentially telling her that while I was still crazy about her it was time that I carried on with my life, we had sex one last time and I came back home focused on trying to get over her.
Fast-forward to September - I came back from a long holiday to a plethora of messages from her, she started talking to me considerably more often than before (almost daily); she started sending me ""xx"" at the end of her messages; she started telling me she missed me and for the very first time she called me, just to chat. During the call she also explained that her work is going to start sending her through to my city a bit more regularly, so she will be able to see me more often. 

Girl 2 [29/F] comes into the picture 2 weeks ago - she is intelligent, independent, great fun, super beautiful and lives in my city. I had an opportunity at a wedding to sleep with her, but turned it down due to this Catch 22 I feel I am in, but we carried on talking, and the more we did, the more I realised she really is someone I could see myself with.

In conclusion [TL;DR] - Do I turn away Girl 2 because of the recent behavioural changes from Girl 1 (to try be the honorable guy yet again), or are the behavioural changes from Girl 1 not enough? Do I try a different approach for the first time in being a bit more selfish by seeing both girls until 1 of them gives me a clearer answer on what they actually want out of this?

Sorry for the long post, your advice will be super appreciated!!
Much love"
436,"
 I am in high school and I really like this girl at my school and she knows that I like her. She likes me back as well. I only have one class with her and then I only see her twice in the halls. I never have enough courage to say have a conversation with her or even enough just to say hi. I’ve talked to her about her losing interest in me, but she never explicitly told me that she did or didn’t lost interest in me. She’s says that she is a bad communicator just like me but I’m not sure if she’s telling the truth. She also told me that she feels like I don’t want to talk to her and rather text her. What can I do to not make her feel this way.

What are somethings that I can do to really know for sure that she loses interest in me.

Dm if u want to know what she said and can help me figure out if she lost interest in me"
437,"Our relationship is pretty new, about two months, and my feelings for him are strong enough that I've been kind of watching myself to make sure I don't come on too strong. Like, I'm not playing games, but I'm just trying to keep down the intensity level. His pet is very sick, though, and probably dying. I'm sad and sad for him, and want to do what I can to make him feel better. What, if anything, can I do? What would you do in this situation? We're 37 and 31, opposite gendered couple, if that matters."
438,"I originally posted on r/AITA for advice on whether or not I had reason to end things with a guy, and after everyone saying I was valid in my concerns I wanted to post here. 

I’ve been ‘talking’ to a guy for a couple weeks and we’ve been on two dates. I’ve noticed some red flags when it comes to his mental health. He has acknowledged that he suffers from anxiety and depression but hasn’t done anything about them. 

I can only be supportive, recommend counseling, suggest talking things out with his friends, and provide input on different medication options before I feel drained and like a broken record. I know how unresolved mental health issues can end relationships. I don’t want that to happen again, especially with a guy who already seems very attached to me. It genuinely worries me. He mentioned me ghosting him as a joke early on which seemed kind of like a manipulation tactic so I wouldn’t want to ghost him. 

I’m trying to weigh my options so that this doesn’t end horribly. I don’t want to continue this relationship before it’s too deep of a connection. I also don’t want to ghost him entirely because I would feel incredibly guilty even if he didn’t do something drastic afterwards. I know I’m not responsible for his actions either way. I just want to end it responsibly and carefully, but I’m at a loss for how to do that without being a horrible person."
439,"ok so recently my gf has been having mixed feelings towards me (one day she likes me and has all these feelings the next she doesn’t even want me to compliment her but that’s not the story) and i haven’t seen her in a week because she wants to be alone after school (i’m homeschooled). so this morning she doesn’t text me until 8 because she forgot her phone at home and she said she didn’t wanna go back to school. so i ask if she just wants to hang out and that it could be good for us (cuz she has weird feelings about US). so she says she does want to and we meet up and everything, eat, and go to an arcade (a good ass date if you ask me) but after we were done at the arcade her dad texts her “the school called again” and calls her and she doesn’t answer because she ditched. so she says she wants to go back to school but by the time we get there there’s an hour left and she still didn’t wanna go. the whole time she had her phone shut off and when she turned it on she got a bunch of texts from her mom and sister saying “where are you?” “i’m worried about you” “please respond” and so she starts panicking. so after school ends (even tho she didn’t go) we go back to her school and get stuff from her locker. as we were walking to stairs to leave she stops and just stands there and i hug her (i felt bad the whole time because it was my idea for her to ditch and hang out with me). after a couple seconds it REALLY started to hit me (ngl i kinda started to tear up thinking that she would hate me for asking her to ditch and might even break up with me) and so she back up and says “you look like you’re about to cry” but i sucked it up and told her i was fine (i don’t want her to see me like that) so i walk her home and before she actually goes to her house we stop and hug for a bit and i ask her if she hates me and she says to not worry about it (but here i am worrying about it). she got her phone taken away as she hasn’t been online in the past 8 hours and i feel TERRIBLE. ik this is all my fault an that she is in a lot of trouble all because i wanted to hang out for the day. if i had just told her to go back to school none of this would have happened but then the AMAZING day we had (before her parents found out she wasn’t at school) wouldn’t have happened either and ik she was having fun and was actually FEELING our relationship (because of things she did while we were together).   
do you (anyone reading) think she’ll hate me for basically getting her in trouble? it was MY idea and because of it she’s in a lot of trouble rn

not looking for anyone to say “you two shouldn’t have ditched” or “she shouldn’t have listened to you” or anything like that just needed a place to kinda vent and ask the question above"
440,"For background I’m 17m and a senior in his. She’s a sophomore 15f in high school. I was texting her today and she asked me if I wanted to go to homecoming and or a date. I wanna say yes but I’m not sure if the age gap is too significant since we are still young. I just feel like it’s pretty creepy when I turn 18 to be dating a 16 year old. I understand that in the future the age gap will be nothing, but it seems so large rn. My dilemma is to say yes or no and I’m just having cold feet."
441,"Been with my SO now for 5 years, lived with each other for almost 3 years. We have a great relationship and communicate extremely well. Still to this day my stomach gets all weird when I see her every morning. At this point she adds so much to my life. She has told me similar things to me, last week she told me after our date (I try to go out 2 times a month with her) she didn’t see a future without me in it. After that I had to hold back tears, later that night I walked and cried. I’m not a emotional person at all but that drove a steak of love through my heart. Im wondering should I wait some more, or pop the question? I don’t want a future without her at this point."
442,"Well I think this will be the last time I come back to this account as my last few post have really shown me where my marriage is at. But my husband and I been having problems for the past 4-5 months I saw he commented on r/GoneWild no biggie, I got over it. But just while I was sleeping he figured out how to message on Reddit, I taught him like a dumbass I am, and now he's sent a message to a specific girl (on r/BadDragon), to clarify I told him NO MESSAGING, those were my boundaries! And now not only do I feel betrayed once again I feel as if I can never trust him knowing he doesn't respect me, am I overreacting? Genuinely what do you guys think about this? Should I just not give a shit? Is this even really a problem? I feel like it is.. My heart hurts."
443,"I posted earlier this evening about the logistics of breaking up when we live together. The potential break up is really weighing on me so I just want to spill my guts on why I am considering ending the relationship with my (23M) girlfriend (24F) of 4+ years that I met in college and, despite wanting to break up with, love and care for deeply.

So I’m going to list the glaring flaws that I see in her that I’ve addressed multiple times. She either ignores my opinion on them or she fixes them and they resurface a few months later. To keep things fair I’ll list the flaws I have that I’m aware of too.

Just want some opinions on if this is salvageable or if it’s time for me to end it.

Her flaws:

- She has absolutely 0 friends. When we met she had a bunch but over the years she’s fallen out of touch with them or destroyed the relationship with how one track minded she can be. Some of her friends were also just very lazy and put no effort in to maintaining the relationship. I feel bad for since I have a lot of close friends and am always going out for dinner/drinks with them. I invite her along frequently but she usually declines or gets annoyed when she sees me having a good time with them. Some other things I’ll pull from this:
- very hard headed and one track minded. It’s her way or nothing
- gets jealous when I do things with my friends and tries to make me feel bad when I leave the house to go do things with them even if I invited her along and she declined
- she hates seeing me have a good time with people other than her
- she’s very childish. She talk in a baby voice, quotes children’s tv shows multiple times a day, and pokes/tickles/pinches me despite me telling her how annoying I find it
- she’s become more and more lazy and messy the longer we’ve lived together. She works long hours and works hard but expects me to do all the house work. Which is generally fine since I work from home and have a flexible job but I find it rude that me being the home maker is an expectation rather than a perk of my job
- speaking of the job, she constantly makes remarks about my job being a joke. I don’t feel that she respects me or my career even though I work in finance at a great company. Just because I work remotely doesn’t mean my job is any less stressful than hers but disagrees and thinks I’m incapable of being stressed if I can be home all day.
- 3 years ago we got in a fight about a picture on Instagram of me at a work function with my arm around one of my (very attractive) female co workers. She was just a friend and I was posing for a picture. I never cheated on her and never gave her a reason to think I was. Yet the fight we had I may as well have. She still brings it up to this day.
- she is very jealous even to the point she gets mad at me if I leave a good tip to an even remotely attractive waitress (I tip well to everyone that gives great service... just clarifying)
- when we watch movies she expects me to look away if there’s a scene with a naked girl in it and has physically stormed out of the room when I didn’t.
- she complains about everything. Usually she complains about work for a few hours when she gets home, then had a complaint to make about dinner, then complains about whatever activity we do after dinner, and wraps up the evening by complaining about something I did during the day that annoyed her. If she still has some left in the tank she complains about me not trying to be intimate with her that evening. In the event I can get in the mood after 5 hours of hearing and addressing her complaints she usually had some thing negative to say about the sex (which is generally pretty great - I definitely don’t bring my A game when I’m annoyed with her though...)
- she disagrees with my religious and political views, which is totally fine, except that she constantly uses them to belittle me as if my views are inferior to hers.
- she gets mad at me for going to the gym. I’ve always been into fitness since I met her but recently she hasn’t felt confident in herself so she says that I’m just trying to look good so I can leave her. This is absolutely ridiculous because she’s incredibly attractive and she knows it

Now to be fair, I’m not perfect either. Just some glaring issues that she’s addressed with me:

- I definitely drink too much. I go out for happy hour twice a week plus like to go out with her or friends on the weekends. I’m the furthest thing from an angry drunk though. And we never get in drunk arguments aside from one time she was belittling my job in front of some of her friends at a bar and I told her she was being a a rude b** and went to stay at a friends house for the evening.
- I don’t communicate well. I’ve told her everything on that list bothers me but I usually let it eat at me for a few weeks before I get overwhelmed and snap. I hate yelling and arguing so I usually just bring up 4 or 5 annoying things she did to discuss at once and it ends up being a whole evening long discussion. 
- I try to see my friends 3 times a week and my recently divorced parents once every other week. I know she doesn’t have any friends but sometimes I don’t even make an attempt to invite her or make sure she has something to do. Is this my responsibility??
- I have a dark sense of humor. Sometimes she thinks it’s hilarious but recently she just thinks it’s annoying. I hate holding my tongue when I have something funny (albeit crude) to say
- I have a lot of female friends, mostly ex co workers or class mates, and I know she hates it. I feel bad that it makes her upset but I’ve never given her a reason to think I would cheat and I never hang out with these people outside of a large group setting
- I have a bad habit of running into old friends and not introducing her right away. 

Thanks for reading.. I’d appreciate any advice on if you think these flaws are something I’m able to work through or if the list is just too long for it to be feasible."
444,"Tl;dr I need to leave my boyfriend whos' kids I have been raising for 6 years but don't know what to tell the kids or how to deal with all of it. 

Okay, roller coaster here. 
I (24F) have been dating T (39M) for 6 years.

 I was in a bad place when we started dating, basically it was a relationship out of convenience and we both agreed going in that it would not be a permanent arrangement. 

Fast forward 6 months and T's drug addict, crazy, seperated-but-not-divorced-ex wife calls him and asks if he wants custody of the 3 children (10m,9f,7f) that he hasn't had contact with in 3 years. 
Bear in mind that we are both living with my sister at this time (I was young and have a tendency to do things ""all or nothing"" which is why we were already living together) 

He asks me and my sister about it. We say yes. Go pick up these 3 children, days after christmas, and move them in with us (strangers to them).
This begins what is the most difficult journey of my life. 

These children have been neglected, abused and are lacking skills that they definitely should have. The middle child would literally try to physically fight me if things weren't going her way. I get them all into therapy and do everything I know to do to help them. Talking to the therapist and doing my own research to try everything. We do see improvement but it took a long time. 

Through all this, T followed my lead on everything. I don't think he did a single thing of his own accord. I had to tell him, ask him, hint that it would be a good idea, ect. He is not a very involved father. He blames his abusive childhood, I bought it at first but it's a tired excuse now. 

Fast forward to now, 6 years later. T let his oldest child move back in with bio-mom (after letting him couch surf for a few months...his 15 year old) we pretty much have NC with them. Horrible place for him to be but not much I can do about it. 

I now have a son by T, he's 5 months old. I love all of the children, the girls have come a long way and I thought everything was alright. T still wasn't the father I wanted for my children but I had stayed this long so they would at least have a decent mother figure to look to. 

Last month the girls started telling their guidance counselor, therapist and anyone in a position of power who would listen that my parents and I (who we have all lived with for at least 4 years, wonderful people and not just saying that because they birthed me) along with T; have been abusing them, withholding food and making them scrub the floors on hands and knees. (I guess they are Cinderella??)
Of course, like any good adult would do, these things were reported to DCS. (No sarcasm, It was a good call to report it. No one could have known they were lying and protecting the children is always the priority) 

The case was closed almost immediately. We had a home visit and interview, and they closed it then and there. These claims were obviously lies. 

I've really tried to just get back into the swing of things but I'm struggling really bad with it. I worry about what else they may think up to say. 
I feel like it may have been the final straw for me and I want to end the relationship with T. Our kids deserve to see their parents in a good, healthy, happy relationship and we don't have that. 

He lives in his shop and smokes pot all day while avoiding the rest of us while I live in the house with the rest of the family and take care of the children. 
Its setting a bad example and I had been justifying it because idk what would happen with the girls if we break up. I have no grounds for custody. They are old enough now to have a say in court but I never wanted to put them through that. Now it's not just about them though. It's about my son too. I don't want him to grow up thinking that the way his dad is, is okay. We all deserve better. 

I have tried to leave several times over the years and caved when it came time to talk to the kids, or caved days later when he wouldn't leave me alone. 
I feel much more sure of it than I ever have and I am in a good place mentally and emotionally. 
I am still struggling with it though. It's a big change, even though I know it will be for the best.
I really am just looking for some reassurance and validation. Along with advice on what I should tell the girls. I don't want them out of my life and if they wanted to stay with me, I would make it work. I don't want to be just another person in their lives that leaves/let's them down. 
TIA
Tl;dr I need to leave my boyfriend whos' kids I have been raising for 6 years but don't know what to tell the kids or how to deal with all of it."
445,I’m here to vent I been in this relationship for a year and 9 months and it seems to be going to trash I wish I could explain it better but we’re long distance and it seems like this girl could Careless we haven’t talked all day she’s busy with her family right now but then she shares memes on Facebook but can’t answer a text. I love her but I wish I could have a girl at times that just loves me and shows me affection all the time like I do. I feel like if you love someone enough you’re gonna always show them you care and make them feel special &amp; she doesn’t do that not always I talk to her about it saying what’s wrong and she always says nothings wrong or gets upset I just don’t get what to do ? Should. I just stop caring and do what she does to me at times just to show her how it feels ? But then like I have a natural fear of getting cheated on and I feel like she would talk to some other guy or something although she hasn’t in the past.
446,"So I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 months but we’ve known each other since high school. Most of our relationship has been long distance. We love each other very much but I have needs and they’re not being met since he is living in Japan because of being in the marines. Am I a bad person for wanting this?

A guy I used to date in high school asked me out to breakfast and coffee. I told him I have a boyfriend but he still wants to hang out. What should I do?

EDIT: he’s not in the the field and in his words he’s a “glorified travel agent” and he also supports Bernie for all you trump supporters"
447,"Note: This is a new account, but I'll be using other subreddits, not a throwaway :)

I lived with a guy two years ago in a temp student houseshare after I came out of a relationship of two years and he was perfect; he was always there, he made me laugh, he took me out when I felt crap. There was a spark. We knew everything about each other after two weeks. He was everything my ex wasn't (spending new years alone was the standard). I've dated a couple of people since but nothing comes close to how he made me feel.

I knew he had heart problems, he was on beta blockers (I think?) for HCM. He went into cardiac arrest when he was 14 years old prior to that.

I moved out after three months and I guess I just wanted to move on past it all? I spent two years in a crap relationship, the time wasn't right. He got the message after a while and we eventually stopped talking. When he was moving out he sent me a message, I promised to come and visit him. I didn't. We had a massive argument and I told him I'd moved on and blocked him.

Six months later I was told from a mutual friend that he'd seriously started spiralling. 

His dad died and he had a serious heart scare. I knew his dad was ill, he told me about it before. He started using steroids for bodybuilding and using cocaine before working out (bearing in mind he had a damn heart problem). I got a message from the same person not too long afterwards that he tried to kill himself the previous night. I didn't know how to react, that's not the same person I spent hours talking to every night. Six months prior to that he was my rock (that I ended up treating like crap, granted) and now he's hurting himself?

I wanted to ask him if he was okay but it just felt wrong. I mean this is a guy I hadn't talked to in a year, I wasn't even supposed to know. I didn't know how he'd react to me talking to him, let alone finding out that I knew he needed help.

I saw him in the gym four months ago and I couldn't take my eyes off him. He was definitely more muscular (like holy crap) but there was something not right, I don't know if it was the way he was acting or how his eyes always looked tired. He looked fine on the outside but something in my gut just told me something's wrong.

He sent me a message afterwards asking if we could talk. I really f*****g wanted to, but I don't know it just felt like there was a massive brick wall between us. Honestly, I don't know why I didn't. Because it was awkward? Because I wanted to believe I'd moved on?

He died a week ago in cardiac arrest and I've spent every day crying since I found out. I keep going through our old WhatsApp messages and looking at the gym door hoping he'll walk in. I keep remembering the last night we spent together. I never got to say bye and I don't think I deserved to. I don't know whether to hate him, hate myself or admit that I miss him. His funeral is in two days, as dumb as it sounds maybe it'll mean something to him if I go?

I keep asking myself if there's something wrong with me, whether I could have talked sense into him if I was there, whether I'm partly to blame, and now I'm telling strangers on the internet because I don't know what else to do."
448,"We've been friends for years. The last few years, my feelings for her has grown beyond friendship. Every time we're together, it always feel like there's a lot of energy between us. I've always respected her relationship so I've always tried to keep boundaries. I had to go across country for a business matter and I asked her to come along for moral support. I was half joking but she agreed and came with me. Throughout the entire trip we had an amazing time. It felt very emotionally intimate. We had a deep conversation where she told me that she thinks that I'm amazing and that she came on the trip for me. She followed by saying that she's very unhappy in her relationship. She hasn't mentioned about any relationship issues until now. I didn't pry too much and we continued to have a fun trip. 

My feelings for this girl are strong and I feel like she has feelings for me too. For the last few weeks, I've been going back and forth in my mind if I should tell her how I feel. I feel like I might have a bit of savior complex because I just want her to be happy and I hope that I can be a good partner to her. I know that her happiness isn't my responsibility either. Would it be incredibly selfish to tell her how I feel? If this turns out to be a Jim and Pam love story, I don't want her to feel like she left her partner for me. Last options are waiting or moving on. HELP! Advice anyone?"
449,"Hi so I have been friends for a while with a guy with Aspergers. He is very high functioning. Lives on his own, can use public transport. He also has a trauma history.  He has had very little appropriate    boundaries or discipline in his life and despite social awareness training he wonders why he has very few friends.
So  I have been calling him out on what his sister (also Aspergers) agrees is negative attention seeking behavior. E.g. posting disturbing content on Facebook and then not replying to texts or calls to check in. I told him that if he does this to often people will see it not as a cry for help but as attention seeking and won't support him when he really needs it.
Instead of reacting I calling his mum to get her to check in about things as he wouldn't answer me and was treating me like the substitute support worker.

Now he is angry as he didn't get the attention he wanted from the post and I told his sister what was going on as well, just so she had the heads up due to the trauma history.

 Am I being to judgemental or is it a temper tantrum as he didn't get the attention he wanted, he was frustrated and I did my best to deesclate the situation but whenever he is proven to be wrong especially with female he get really frustrated.

My questions are how do I help him?
Is this a tantrum or a meltdown?
How do I explain he has no friends because he comes off as a jurk? 
Sorry spelling mobile."
450,"My friend doesn’t have reddit, so I’m telling her story for her in hopes she gets advice. She recently made friends with this guy in our school, and he’s real nice and all that. Good guy. However, at a judo studio me and my friend go to, there is another guy that she happened to be crushing on as well, due to previous encounters(think bonding over a haunted house. Truly romantic). Now, her regular friends thinks that she’s crushing on this guy at school, and her judo friends think she’s crushing on the guy in our judo studio. Upon asking her who she really likes, she’s unsure about her own feelings as she has a tendency to “ lead people on” by accident, and doesn’t want to seem like a hoe for doing so. She says that she’s afraid of bonding with the both of them and ending up liking the two. Honestly I don’t know how to help her either. Advice is appreciated much. Thanks!"
451,"I (29F) met this guy (31M) at a karaoke bar. We hit it off and the three of us have fun talking and singing. We exchange numbers and Facebook info. The conversation gets deeper, and I ask if he can drive me home.

When he pulls up to my place he asks if he can kiss me. I say yes, and we make out in his car. We're both thinking the same thing, so I invite him in and he stays the night. We didn't actually have sex. We had both never done this before with a stranger, so we agreed that sex was off the table. But there was a lot more kissing and I share my bed with him. He showers me with compliments and says things like ""How are you single?""

I should mention here that due to my past I have severe anxiety when it comes to sex and relationships. This night took a lot of trust from me. I don't mention any of this to him, though. I just wanted to enjoy my time with him.

The next morning he leaves early to go to church (I am also Christian - something we talked about - but I go somewhere else and not as often). I walk him to the door. He gives me one last kiss and says he's very interested in seeing me again. Later that day he texts me as well, with the same message. I tell him I want to see him again too.

In the meantime, I'm looking at his Facebook posts. He's sharing a lot of memes and posts about things I fundamentally disagree with, so I'm thinking we probably wouldn't go well together. Still, he seemed really nice and I don't want to judge a guy on his memes alone. I text him on Wednesday, and his first response is that he was just thinking about me. We have a nice chat.

The following Sunday I wake up and see ""(Guy's name) is in a relationship with (new girlfriend)"" on Facebook. Facebook algorithm is weird and rehashes old posts, cause the date he started his relationship was apparently Thursday, the day after I texted him. I shoot him a message on Facebook, asking what's up. He hasn't checked it. A few days go by, so I send him a text. Still no response. The next day I call him out for ghosting me, something that actually bothers me a lot. Still nothing.

But he hasn't blocked me from Facebook yet. I don't know his new girlfriend, but I am able to click on her profile and send her a message. It's only been a week and he's tagging her in lots of posts about how happy he is with hearts and stuff. So I can confirm he’s ghosting me.

I'm thinking about messaging her and telling her what went down the week before.

Again, in hindsight I don't think we would have made a great couple. I'm also completely fine with just the one night. Basically I get nothing out of contacting her, except for vengeance because I'm mad that he said one thing to me, did the opposite, and communicated nothing to me. He could have told me to just let that be a one-time thing, or that he met someone or changed his mind. Instead he buttered me up and messed with my trust, and that upsets me. Especially with the aforementioned anxiety issues.

It was a super short turnaround, but it looks like she's a girl from his church so they could have been friends for a long time. Maybe they're in an open relationship (which is something I would have wanted to know beforehand because I'm not into polyamory). The point is, I don't know their lives. Me - a complete stranger - messaging her out of the blue sounds like a crazy bitch move. I know that I'm feeling selfish, I'm mad that he's ghosting, and I can actually do something about it. But I also know that I'm hung up on something I probably shouldn't be. I should just cut my losses and leave them alone.

I also live in a small town, and I'm new here. He's a regular at that bar, and I've met enough friendly people there. I was beginning to like that place and I'm not sure I want to mess that up by starting rumors over the internet or blowing things out of proportion. If I ever see him there though, I'll either ignore him or call him out in person. I can do that and leave this girl alone.

I do wonder about this girl though. I've known some Christians to spontaneously heel-turn and jump into a relationship. In that case I'd be acting as a result of him lying to me, and needlessly dragging her into it.

But if they've been seeing each other for a while before becoming official, then he probably cheated. I've never been cheated on or ""the other woman” before, but I feel like if I were in her shoes I'd want to know that days before starting the relationship he was with another girl. Another reason why I don't want to do nothing.

Should I sent this girl a message calmly explaining what happened between me and her new boyfriend shortly before they announced they were together?"
452,"My ex boyfriend (30M) and (25F) I broke up in May. In sum, we dated for almost 5 years, he initiated the breakup, it was really tough for me the first couple of months, it was my first (and hopefully last) time being heart broken. It wasn't until September or so that I started to feel like myself again. I am much happier now. 

Well this past week this guy and I have been talking and texting a lot and he wants to go out on a date this weekend. This guy seems really sweet and we seem to have a lot in common. I enjoy talking to him but I just don't know if I'm ready to date again. He seems really into me and I don't want to string him along if I'm not emotionally available. So my question is, how do you know when you're ready to date again?"
453,"Buckle up fam, because this is a long one, sorry. 

I (24f) have been with my fiance (24m) for 3 years. We have an almost 2 year old son. 

Typical we screwed all day every day for the first few months thing. Then I got pregnant. He had a problem with alcohol. I encouraged and supported him as he got sober. I made it 100% clear that everything is completely his choice, I can't force him to do anything, all that stuff. He recovers. Has been sober for 2 years. 

But we have sex MAYBE once a month. And that's generous. I try to discuss it. ""I love you to death"" ""I am absolutely still sexually attracted to you"" ""Yes of course I want to be with you"" ""I don't know why"" over and over. I am patient. Understanding. Loving. I make myself always available without pressuring. 

Come to find out he has been masturbating once a week instead of having sex with me because he resents me for ""making"" him stop drinking. I have cried, begged, screamed for answers as to why he won't touch me. I have even told him ""I think you resent me"" and he always said ""No of course not you saved me blah blah blah"" He tells EVERYONE that he doesn't know where he'd be without me. He has a career and a home and a son and has rebuilt relationships with strained family members. All things he didn't have before because of his alcoholism. 

Now, after discussing this thoroughly 20+ times he finally tells me ""I was just hoping it would get better and we'd be fine."" Like fucking magic! Without doing any work! He said he just never thought about it past our discussions. He just didn't think about how the masturbating would effect me despite the fact that I talked to him MULTIPLE TIMES about our lack of sex life and how I don't feel close to him and I feel ugly and rejected. And we've had the discussion before about him masturbating instead of trying to have sex. I am ALWAYS HOME WHEN HE IS. He is literally never in the house without me. He literally hides to go masturbate instead of fucking me! And I have NEVER turned him down.

Now he's begging me to let him ""fix it"". He just keeps saying he's so sorry and he never meant to hurt me and he just didn't think about it.  

Guys idk wtf to do. I am so hurt and angry. I have felt the lowest I've ever felt because of his lack of interest in me and to hear him say that he just didn't think about it despite me being clear about my pain about this and to have him tell me he resents me after two years of saying that wasn't the problem and telling everyone that I saved his life. I don't think I want to be with him anymore. I feel I deserve someone who cares about my feelings and puts effort into our relationship. But I'm also terrified to split up my son's family. He's the perfect father. Just a selfish partner.

UPDATE: He just came to me to tell me it's actually 3-4 times a week... So that's cool. He also called to schedule some therapy sessions so I guess that's good. But I still just don't really know."
454,"So, this is my first ever post here, so please excuse me if I dont follow the status quo format or anything. However, my girlfriend (19) and I (M19) are currently having and slight spat about her transferring to a university 3 hours away. We have only been dating a little over a month and I expressed my doubts and feelings about distance in a relationship. Since then she has been telling me we will make the best of the year we have left together. Until tonight. Tonight she seemed distant and when I asked how she was feeling, she said she was tired and stressed. So we went to her room and laid in bed until she got sleepy and I left to study for my exam in the morning. After I left, she texted me, expressing feelings of hurt and vulnerability that we were just going to be over when she transfers, and questions why I was with her and if i had the same feelings she did, making the comment ""I just feel there is a dedication I have that just isn't there for you"". This all made me feel as though I was about to be dumped the night before and exam, so I just, asked her what she was saying, she said she wasnt going to end things, that she was trying to get things off her chest and that she was worries she has stronger feelings for me than I do for her. I expressed my belief that this conversation would be better served in person, and that we should talk about it. She wished me a goodnight and good luck on my exam then went to sleep, this is where our conversation ended. What do I even do? I'm so confused and, demoralized, for lack of a better word."
455,"So me (25F) and my boyfriend (28M) have being together a little over a year now and we love each other dearly and are supportive of each other's decisions. 
He is super smart and a hard-working individual and has earns quite well and he was looking forward for the next step in his career but didn't get through with the yearly promotion at work. I know he deserves it because he takes up all the work on behalf of his team and needs to be recognised for it.
His manager however addressed it as he will definitely qualify for it next year and that his work is very well appreciated. It is due to the lack of transparency in the team that the management is not aware of the actual hard work he puts into his job. 
So basically I'm asking how can I be supportive to him though he didn't get the promotion because I know it really upset him and he felt down because of it. I tried to tell him that he deserves better and they will understand how hard he works only when he resigns the company. He agrees with me but he randomly brings up how some people got promoted just like that and not him. I already told him babe you are already winning in life and that everything will only get better. Me trying to tell him that things outside work is amazing and our relationship is only getting better and stronger might not help the case or him being upset over the promotion. He says he's glad to have a supportive girlfriend and that other people who got promoted don't have me! 
Basically my question is how to lift his spirits up despite what he is going through at work."
456,"Hey guys so title is pretty self explanatory!

Little Summary:

Been seeing this girl for awhile now. Really like each other, holding hands, cuddling, going on dates, etc. 

Then finally when the time came, we kissed. 
Not a great kiss. In fact, really pretty terrible.


I suspect it's mostly my fault on this one. Didn't choose any sort of special moment, just kinda went for it because I felt like we'd been seeing each other for long enough that it would start to get weird if it didn't happen sooner or later... we both kinda laughed it off and tried again. 

Better the second attempt, but still not great! 

There was no awkwardness after or any sort of ""oh fuck we fucked this whole thing up"" type feeling, she was pretty chill about. 

Just kinda looking for some words of advice/comfort, feeling the general nervousness that comes with a situation like this and hoping that I haven't committed a major deal breaker...."
457,"Hi everyone, first time posting here, looking for some clarity for preventing future situations like this, and advice on how to proceed.

**BACKGROUND:** My partner and I both live in a very closed off developing country. We are very obviously foreign and because we are young, attractive, and very different (appearance wise) from locals, we stand out like a sore thumb. Additionally, the local population is extremely observing by nature. So eyes are on us 24/7 and it can actually be extremely stress-inducing and uncomfortable at times. For the most part I've developed a thick skin, but especially at times where my partner and I are at odds with one another, it can be too much. We are going through a healing time where we are both trying to grow and be better for ourselves and one another, and have each contributed negatively to the relationship in the past. I say this to simply add some context beyond the post: we are both human and I don't want this post to paint a dynamic that sways peoples opinion. So please take the instance for what it is, as written.

**INCIDENT:** My girlfriend very sweetly came up to my township (we work approx. 12 minutes away by taxi) for lunch, as she's done a few times. I have not been coming down to her because my work is more strict with lunch timing and I have more responsibility at work where I'm required to be here and have deliverables that need attending to. I do not say this to put down her work life. She is unfortunately, by her own accounts, in a job where she doesn't have funding for projects and so, there are no projects. She is very, very disheartened by her current professional position and her workday is 85% of the time spent reading or browsing the web because there is no work for her. That being said, I have said I will come down to her one week, but this week she was okay with coming here.

After arriving and getting our food to the checkout counter, she wanted me to pay for an item that she uses almost exclusively for herself: olive oil. This is not native to the region, has to be imported, and was a large bottle. So the price ends up being twice that of home, beyond what I wanted to spend for the day (we have been spending an exorbitant amount of money on eating out, trips, raves, etc.) and I said I would prefer not to pay for it since I do not use it in my cooking (she is Spanish and olive oil is an integral part of her sangre). She was very unhappy about this and began listing reasons why that was unfair, namely: that she pays for things that she doesn't end up eating, she buys little things for me, and that she buys things without asking for money. For the sake of keeping this short: the times I end up eating the meat we paid for equally alone, were times she didn't because we ate out and the food would go bad, or she left on trips (she frequently leaves the city we are in for visa runs, family related trips, etc.). I do 100% of the cooking, so she also does not cook these foods if they're in danger of going bad. I frequently bring home items for the house without asking her to pay. But because I have not kept the receipt of 100 items over the course of 6 months, she doesn't accept it as valid. Recently I also have been making more efforts to gift-give, a love language I'm well versed in, but admit I slacked on previously because of my poor financial situation (now much better).

I did not fight with her in public, and gave her the half of our total bill, but said I didn't want to pay this much money and that it bothered me. We got change back, equivalent to pennies, in the form of a single money note, that she stuffed into the neckline of my shirt, saying ""here, since you obviously need it and its such a big fucking deal"". The cashier saw it, people in line saw it, people I wasn't even aware of probably saw it. And although they likely didn't understand her words, her actions hurt me and it embarrassed me. I asked her to apologize please or I didn't feel comfortable having lunch. She refused, at which point I asked her to split the lunch we bought. She took the majority of items (in terms of quantity and cost), left me with the groceries for the house that we bought, ran up the stairs and began calling a taxi service back to her job. I asked her to apologize again (stupid of me, I know) and she repeated many of the things said before. I did not retaliate, said I was hurt and that I needed to go back to work. I walk back and right before crossing the street to enter my building, her taxi passes by and she puts half her body out the window to flip me off. Texts followed calling me a monster, saying I was greedy, cruel, and that I never return the favor financially. I told her this was manipulative and really mean, and now she's told me to leave her alone several times and we haven't messaged for an hour.

**QUESTION:**  Is there a way that I could have behaved better? I didn't lash out at her but is there a way to sensitively handle this situation in the future, should a disagreement of money arise? Again, I cannot unpack the whole relationship so please understand I love this woman and am not seeking validation or a morale boost to leave. My girlfriend is STRUGGLING mentally right now because of her lackluster work situation and it is highly likely (some clinical assessments made) she is experiencing depression on top of confirmed GAD. I'm looking for an outside party to maybe point out something in my choices that I can fix, or point me in the right direction towards how I can support someone who may be acting out, but still stand by my wishes.

Thanks to anyone who made it this far. Can't honestly say I would have (not the juiciest post). Happy to provide any information as needed."
458,My GF of 2 years just told me that she wants to have a fwb that she can have sex with because I'm the only person she's ever been with and she wants to 'try the market'. I dont know how to feel about this.
459,"Thank you for reading everyone,

I work at my local university as a bus driver, I'm a student. And I got out of an abusive relationship where my girlfriend guilts me for various things (mainly steming around sex and asking her to do her part in chores, driving, etc.) And it's taken somewhat of a toll on me and it's made me loose interest in dating. I kind of expect that, but I would really like to make more, new friends. Preferably people who she doesn't know. Because she knows my current friends and tries to yell at me and guilting me for friends I'm hanging out with that she doesn't like. I can't get her out of my life right now, we're in a lease together and I sleep in the living room (1br + living room and bathroom), so subleasing isn't ideal. So I'm looking for more friends to spend more time with to keep myself away from our apartment. 

So, going back to the bus driver. While I'm in no rush to be in a relationship, I've always been shy or awkward around girls. I'd like to make more friends and I believe girls could be a pretty good friend addition because they kind of understand how I feel (emotional abuse, unfortunately girls receive it far more often), and are generally a lot more willing to be kind and ""there"" for you.. long story - I want more diversity in friends. So all of these girls ride the bus, some seem quiet, some not. I do my best to respect their interests, so I ask them what they are studying, how they are doing, and unless I'm feeling really depressed I try to keep the fact that I'm living with an abusive ex outside of conversation as much as humanly possible. I think some of my best options for meeting girls is at work, I'm very comfortable talking to people, I just don't know how to go from ""hi Mr. Bus driver"" to ""hey can we grab coffee and study or something?"".. again, I'm not looking for a hookup or a relationship, merely friends. I just don't know how to tell people that I like them in a friendly way to get their Snapchat, etc. I 100% don't want to be a creep about it..

I'm sorry for the sporadic reply, I'm feeling a little down tonight. I saw a really cute girl that I liked and she was super nice to me but I just couldn't figure out how to talk to her in a way that she'd be interested in being friends.. maybe I'm overthinking.

Thanks everyone :)"
460,"So I've known this guy for almost 5 years now,  we exchange memes on facebook, comment on each other post etc. Earlier this year, I broke up with an ex and my Fb account was hacked..  So we lost contact. 

I made new facebook account, fast forward 6 months later, I saw him on facebook ""dating"" app, similar to tinder for those of you who didn't know. So I went and liked his profile, he texted me and yeah, we started talking/texting from that day on.
We text all the time! Oh, and I forgot to mention that we never see each other in real life before, well not until last month. 

The first time we met, it was so nerve wrecking!  I mean, I've known this man virtually for so long yet it's our first time meeting! The meeting was okay, he look exactly as he looked like in the photos. Which is pretty good looking I would say. When the movie ended, he send me to my car and we went our separate ways. Few minutes later, he texted me saying I look skinnier in person which is a compliment to be honest. LoL So yeah,  that leads to more texting and so on. 

Fast forward few weeks back, we went drinking with our friends (me with my friends, him with his)  and then somehow, I drunk texting him asking him he would like to join me and my friends?  Which he obviously replied yes. 
As the night goes by, we started getting closer..  Holding hands etc. (we never have any physical contacts prior to this) and at some point, we both left everyone else and went back to my apartment. I think we all know what happen next, right? 

The next morning was really really awkward for me coz, one thing is that,  I can't really remember what happen?  I mean, I know we had sex and all but I don't remember certain things, like how we got home or how did we even enter the apartment. lol also, like I said, we never do anything physical before,  not even a hand touch. So it's really awkward. I thought I ruined everything.. But then, he went back,  and texted me few minutes later. So everything goes back to normal, we didn't mention that night. 

Last week, we made a plan of having a dinner at my place,  I'll cook and we gonna watch Netflix or something. But then,  he bailed on me the night before, saying that his ex classmate invited him for a birthday dinner. I was a little hurt? To say the least..I mean... I thought I was special.  HAHAHA. Also, we planned this a week ahead! But anyways, me being me, I told him that it's okay, we'll plan again next time. Then we talk/text like normal. 

I think I developed a feeling for him?  Coz we do talked alot. But at the same time, I don't know what's the deal with him?  He text me all the time, we flirt a little bit here and there. But then, at the same time, I don't think he really make an effort to spend time with me?  Like, it feels like his friends are more important to him than anything else.oh, and he told me he's been single for 7 years. Doesn't make any sense, he has the look,  and seems like a genuine person overall. Wonder what could be the problem?  He told me,  he's always been the kind of person who let things flow and see where it brings him? I mean, I don't mind taking things slow,  but I needed to have a clear vision of what might be there in the future?  Or at least a clear line, between being a normal friends, or something else? We never discuss anything about us though. I don't wanna be the one who bring up this topic. Coz he doesn't seem to mind us being like this. I honestly don't know where are we both heading. 

Tomorrow, he is asking me whether we can hangout and then proceed to tell me,  coz tomorrow is the only time that he's free,  as Saturday,  he have plans with his friends. Drinking etc. I told him,  I'm not sure. (I have zero plans actually) I just didn't wanna be the kind of person he goes to when he doesn't have anyone to hangout with. I'm seriously confused. Help?  I don't know what to think of this person? Or what is his intention. What should I do?  Sorry for the long background stories. Also, English is not my first language. By the way,  I'm (F-26) he's (M-30)"
461,"So I’ve been dating this chick for like a year and 4 months. And we’ve gotten to know each other and we clicked very well. So we attended the same college for a year and around July this year her dad took her back to Alaska because that’s where she’s from (I live in California). Her father deceived her in moving back for a temporary time and then go back to California  which never happened. So me and her are doing the long distance relationship and we’ve been doing well for a little bit I’ve taken two trips to Alaska to visit. But here’s the side thing; her father disapproves of me and on July he forced her to break up with me and she’s listened to her dad and it happened. But long story short on that process the both of us rekindled and she was happy to see me. So my second trip to Alaska took place around the beginning of October and we’ve been discussing it and she wanted to get pregnant hence she said that would be her only way out of Alaska and go back to California. So my foolish ass went up there but my plan was to not cum inside of her and make her believe that she’s pregnant in order to bring her back to me. So I was up there and I couldn’t hold back the feeling of pleasure and I came inside of her. Not much because as soon as it happened I felt guilt. And she realized it and took whatever she could of semen out. So then I came back to California, and she’s been telling me that she’s experiencing implantation and an increase of the cervical mucus. So I assume she’s pregnant which at first I had a really hard time accepting but now I’m all in to take care of the baby and be it’s father. But skip forward to last weeknd; me and her had a fight and it ended with me being pissed off and taking it out on objects and out of my own frustration I ended up crying and she couldn’t control me. So then three days later we had another argument and I said by accident and I wish I never said it because it made her tell me that she’s had enough. And I said “what do you think is easier to just give up on us and focus on our own personal lives”. And she listened to it and kept on telling me that she’s had enough. And for the past few days I’ve been trying to talk to her and all she’s doing is throwing at my face that she doesn’t want anything to do with me and that she wants to see other people. And it got to the point that I caught her on tinder. So right now she’s telling me that she literally doesn’t want anything to do with me but yet she still answers my texts when I text her and bothers to open my snaps when I send her pics. So then I’m confused what should I do? Because I don’t want her to raise the baby on her own and seeing other people hell no; I know the both of us love each other a lot but honestly it’s only been three weeks since I came inside of her and I’m just lost as to how I should engage this problem. Like I want to give her space but then I don’t because I want to check on the baby’s growth and things like that. So tell me guys. What should I do with a moody pregnant woman who’s literally ghosting me and threatening me to break up and that she’s gonna see other people? I know this is bullshit but I want to know a way to confront to her. Any advice would be good. Thank you"
462,"I, 18 F have been having causal sex with a friend, 30 M for a while now. We have a very complicated history and our age difference was quite a concern at first. We truly click and have ridiculous sexual chemistry, so after some time and hanging out, we decided to go through with it. It was the most amazing sex I’ve ever had and I can only think about him when intimate with anyone else, and I don’t get nearly as turned on than if I was with him. We had an intimate relationship prior to my new job... in which he is my boss. We keep things on the DL and no one knows about it, but after all this time together sexually and as friends, I feel like I have definite feelings for him and want to know how he feels in return, but is frightened it’ll ruin our whole relationship and even my job. What do I do??!"
463,"So... My gf of a year and a half has a classmate who I thought was only her friend, but few things happened that led me to think there was something more about that relationship:

1. Once she was going to tell me something about a classmate, but stopped and told me: well, it's better no to tell you because you are going to think that I just go to school to flirt.

2. Another day I was calling to her phone but she didn't answer me, right after that class ended, and after she had texted me 5 minutes before I called her. It was not a serious thing, then she told me that she didn't answer because she was with her classmates making friends.

3. Weeks later I texted her I was near the campus and to meet her after her class. She read my texts but ignored me and called me back after an hour or later. Then she told me she forgot to check her phone and she was with her classmates. I mean, it's fine if she is making friends, but she didn't have to ignore me.

5. One day, she asked me if I liked another girl. Which I considered strange because she hadn't asked that before.

4. This is when shit hit the fan, she was upset because her class didn't go well because a couple of partners laughed at her. I tried to calm her, but then she told me that she liked one of those guys too much and that hurt her, I asked: too much??? And then she started crying and  told me he hit on her. This led to an argument, she told me that she isn't into the monogamous thing, and despite of that she hadn't cheated on me (additionally, she had told me in the past that she cheated on her previous bf's and fucked another guys). I told her, no probs but I don't wanna be with you anymore because i don't want you to be with other people. Then she cried and told me that i am everything to her and that i am the only one and begged me to not leave her. Alright then!

5. She logged in her msssenger account in a phone that I gave to her once. He gave it back to me and I noticed she hadn't logged out, so I told her: hey look! And she immediately take the phone and was in a rush to log out. I asked wtf are you hidding and she told me: I don't want you to see something awful. And wtf!? I waited to be alone with her to tell her wtf!? Are you flirting with that guy??? She told me yes. I asked her what did she tell him or what did she do, she answered that telling me won't make things better and begged me to not leave her. She promised she wouldn't do that again and that it was a mistake, and that it was just flirting and that she blocked him on social media. I believed her, but told her  i was very disappointed, and told her that I trust her.

6. Yesterday she had an abortion, I stayed with her through all the process, and paid for all that. Before entering surgery she was going to tell me something but didn't, telling me that she needed me on her side and that telling me would cause an argument. I didn't pushed, I accepted.

7. Today she told me that he (her classmate) is her friend, and that he is the only person that helps her in her class. I told her: he is not friend, he is only a guy that you barely know and that wants to flirt with you, have you told him to stop?. She told me, mad: I don't need to tell him to stop, he is more intelligent than you and knows I have a bf and he doesn't need to be told everything like you. I responded: well, I am sure he already knew in the past that you had a boyfriend and despite of it flirted with you, and worse, you were the girl with the boyfriend and you even flirted with him.

Then she told me: well then you can dump me, I don't need you and won't be sad. I have many problems with the abortion to have more problems with you.

And that was it, she is asleep beside me, while I'm writing this shit. I don't know what to do. I need some advice. Sorry for the long post.

TL, DR: as the title said,my gf of one and a half years flirted with another guy, then promised me she wouldn't do it anymore, and that she blocked him. Now she says he is her friend. Wtf?"
464,"So I was dating this girl, and I thought we had something, like we would talk for hours and I would listen to her problems and she would listen to mine.

Well I moved away and I was replaced by another guy a few weeks after I left, it came out of nowhere for me and I tried to be understanding about it but it just hurts because now I can’t move on from her, I always worry about her and I still listen to her problems. 

But now I’m posting this because today she told me that her and this new guy kissed, so now all my hopes of getting back together are just gone, and I feel horrible about it because she’s waiting for me to respond and I feel numb, I don’t want to respond and I just feel like I’m failing in life, I want to cry but I can’t and it’s horrible.

If someone actually reads this, thank you you are a great person, and please tell me what to do because I don’t know what to do"
465,"Title. I couldn’t take knowing she saw my every post, always watching anymore. My crush stopped talking to me after she found out her ex watched my twitter like a hawk. They may still like each other. Having blocked her I felt safer but I know there’s gonna be some repercussion in that the ex will know she’s gotten to me. Perhaps it will inspire her even further against me. In the very least I fear it’s undone a tortious evening where I pretended to get along with her and she asked to follow my twitter. Would the alternative have been my own torture"
466,"(Sorry if this post is a bit disorganized) So I’m a freshman at high school and I have a fairly medium sized Indian friend group with a decent amount of girls. However, I’ve come to the  realization that I don’t really interact with them that much. I’m familiar with most of them but I only talk to two of them at a “friend level” amount. I only have like 2 girls numbers. My parents are worried to the point that they think I might end up gay. I really do not look forward to being gay. My brother (17M) socializes with a ton of girls. He has so many of their phone numbers. For some reason, not many of the girls in my friend group interact with me. I feel like my male friends are giving a bad impression of me to them. I also feel that my personality is boring to them. Whenever my friends are talking  to the girls, I try to join in on the conversation but I end up being left out. I don’t think my appearance has a negative impact. I’m a competitive swimmer at 6’2 and fairly muscular. My face is pretty decent although my  skin color is a bit dark (I’m North Indian). I can’t pinpoint why, but I still have trouble socializing with girls in the friend group. I only talk with 2 or 3 girls as friends. How can I socialize with girls the same way I do with my male friends? Any advice will help."
467,"Obligatory, on mobile, throwaway account, formatting, blah blah. 

I just discovered I’m pregnant, and am freaking the hell out. I’m not in an official relationship with the father, despite both of us having really complicated feelings for each other. I don’t want to go to much into our history as it’s very tying to us and I haven’t told anyone else the “news” yet. We were really good friends before hand, and just recently started “seeing” each other in a more intimate fashion. We’ve had sex like three times and I was on birth control. I wasn’t seeing anyone else. 

Here’s the thing, I don’t want a kid. He doesn’t want a kid, he has a very complicated relationship currently with an ex that has two kids that aren’t his. I’m scared to tell him and it sound like i’m trapping him into a relationship (we’ve talked about a relationship but obviously not on this term). I’m also scared to tell him that I don’t want to keep the kid, as that might freak him out. I know I probably need to tell him but I’m just scared of his reaction. 

I’m freaking out and turning to reddit. Someone please talk some sense into me and give me advice on how to proceed. 
Side note: does not mean tell me to keep the kid, it’s not happening. Also does not mean tell me how dumb i am, i’m very aware, currently hating myself.

Edit for clarity i guess: 1. I am not keeping it, there’s no questions about it. Again, as stated multiples times I AM NOT KEEPING IT!
2. The two kids mentioned are NOT his. His ex has two kids with a previous guy and while they were dating he grew an attachment to them, he had no part of their making."
468,"It happens with my family, friends, coworkers, and strangers. At some point during the group conversation I will go quiet. It feels like I am searching to be comfortable. I feel tense. It feels like I need to get out of there to catch my breath. 

I’ve tried different techniques but I’m not improving at the rate I want. I’ve tried breathing techniques and mental techniques where I remove myself from the situation, but none have helped that much. I find the biggest thing that helps me is alcohol. When I’m tipsy I can talk freely without inhibitions. It feels a lot better.

What can I do to do this without alcohol? 

It also feels sometimes like the topic of conversation does not interest me and perhaps that’s why I go quiet? Maybe because I don’t know enough about the subject?"
469,"I (26F) recently met and began dating a surgical resident (30M) who is quite literally the greatest (smart, driven, stupidly good looking, fit, kind, fun, awesome sense of humor). It hasn’t been long since we started up, and I know he’s in a rotation right now that is not very highly demanding. He’s already warned me that there will be months coming up that are going to be really challenging and that he won’t have much time to see me (though he still seems incredibly busy to me as of now). This is new territory to me but he’s absolutely incredible and I think we’re both really excited about the possibility of this relationship developing into the real deal. I realize there is a tough road ahead and I would just really love input/advice from people who did a residency or dated someone in it. How did you cope? How can I be supportive without getting in the way? How did you make time for each other or keep from feeling neglected at the busiest times? Etc etc. Thank you Reddit!"
470,"I find myself being ""too much of a gentleman"" with this girl I like. I really want to hug her and touch her but I'm scared she won't like it. I know that she is interested in me but I'm still worried. What should I do?"
471,"Dear Reddit Community,
I write this text because I am deeply frustrated and unhappy and don't really know how to Express myself.
I am now in a relationship with a girl which is in most ways really perfect for me. I know her since school and it is still my first relationship.
The point where I got frustrated was our highly different sex drive.
I think the frustrating point began a little when the relationship started and she always told me how often she had sex with her ex which was according to her at least 2 times a day. This put a lot of pressure on to me. But it was fine for the first year we did not have a lot of sex but still it was regularly. Then we got a fungus which kinda stopped our sex life completely. We sometimes did not hav sex for a month or more and it was fine because I knew it did not feel nice for her.
Now a month ago we actually managed to have therapy which successfully removed the fungus.
I then hoped that we would get back on track with our sexuality or maybe even have more sex then before because it is the first time we  can for a long time but she does not seem interested.
A year ago when I was unhappy I bought a lot of toys to try to get her to experiment stuff and she told me some weeks ago that this was really dumb because I should have talked about our sexuality.
So now I try to talk more about it but actually every time I do it she does not have to say anything.
And always when she speaks about  sexuality she does not speak about ours but about special clubs where she wants to go to have together fun with other girls.
And even though I like this plan it somehow hurts my feelings that she never talks about our sexuality because ""she already tried everything with her exes""
This added up to the frustration level where I am now and I don't know how to handle it.
1. I really want to live out my sexuality with her but I don't want to pressure her.
2.If she does not want to I really kept thinking about an open relationship because I tried the last 3 years to improve our sexual live and I just didn't find a way.
3.But actually I know from her that she always was very sexual and loved it
Maybe somebody experienced something Similar and can share his thoughts on it.
Greetings,
X"
472,"We've been together for 6 years. We've known each other for another three years before that, so 9 years total. We're getting married in February. Or we were, I don't know any more. We're visiting my parents to meet some more of my extended family, so they get to know him before the wedding. My parents offered to host us, and we've been staying in my old room. I'm \[F29\], he's \[M32\].

We are staying with my parents. My fiance wanted to stay at a hotel, but I thought it will be fun to sleep in my old room. And to be here with my mom and dad one last time under their roof before I become a married woman.

My parents have been in a non conventional marriage for a long time. It was a shock for me to learn about it, and I learnt to cope with it. I am not necessarily comfortable with their life styles, but I can't do anything about it. They basically go on dates with other people, spend time with other people, sleep with other people. Had to learn it when I came home a few days earlier from a trip with a friend's family, and my father was sleeping next to another woman, when I was 16. I freaked out then, and my parents had to explain to me it was all fine.

So my fiance could not sleep last night, and went outside for some fresh air because he is not used to sleep away from our bed back home. And he found my mom kissing another guy in my parent's foyer.

So he freaked out, started yelling at her, came and woke me up, demanded I call my father and tell him he found my mom cheating on him.

So my mom had to explain to my fiance about my parent's non conventional marriage, but it didn't go well with him. And once it seemed like he is calming down and starts to accept what my mom was telling him, he figured out I knew about their marriage, and he started freaking out on me.

He told me that he can't trust me any more, that he was set up, that I insisted we stay with our parents so that I can ease him in the idea, so I can enforce my parents principles on our own marriage, and I simply can't get through to him.

My fiance has been cheated on before, his parents have divorced because his mom cheated on his dad, and he doesn't have a good relationship with her, he could barely stomach the idea of having her come to our wedding.

He went to a hotel for tonight, and said he will be leaving back home tomorrow. he's not really answering his phone or texting back.

he says he needs to reevaluate our engagement, that he doesn't think he can marry me knowing I approve my parents marriage style. That I wanted to manipulate him and introduce this life style in our relationship.

The truth is I am ashamed of my parents and their relationships, and I had no idea they will behave like this while my fiance is around, let alone sleeping in their house. he simply doesn't believe me because I haven't talked about it since I've met him. It's not something I find easy to talk about, and the less I think about it the better.

How can I talk with him? I have no interest in my parents style of relationship, I am fully dedicated to my fiance, and I have never been interested in another person since I've met him.

I don't want to lose him over this stupid thing, and I feel ashamed he had to find out about my parents like this. I'd have preferred he never knew.

Please, if anyone has any ideas, I am interested in any suggestions.

Thank you."
473,"My [f32] SO [m32] cheated on me. I only have his side because the other party refuses to acknowledge their part in it, fyi she knew we were in a serious relationship. She just didn't give a shit. Nudes were sent, dates at bars, and a ride to our shared home, which she entered to use the bathroom. He insists nothing physical happened. I have a hard time believing that but I have no proof it isn't. We're attempting to see if we can make it work and rebuild the trust that no longer exists. 

Has anyone out there who has actually experienced being cheated on actually been able to make it work? What did it take and how do you cope with the betrayal?"
474,"I have no desire to anger him, there’s nothing I want more than peace. Usually things are so calm between us, and I think it going wrong was truly my fault. 

I have been so emotionally fragile since giving birth. I thought I’d feel better in time, but my baby is three months old now and I’ve never felt worse in my life. I have no energy. I don’t enjoy anything. I just lay in bed, cry, and drink wine when I am not nursing or taking care of my baby. I love my son more than anything, I really do, but sometimes I just feel a weird feeling of resentment for him. I try to fight it sometimes it gets the best of me.

My husband came home from work and I tried to put a mask on and pretend like everything was fine, but he asked me if I was okay and I just started to cry. I told him how I feel. He did make me feel better, but I still wasn’t feeling great. Very soon after that my baby woke up. I went to his nursery and I just soothed him while he was lying in his crib. My husband came in and watching me for a moment and then I just said something really insane, it just slipped out of my mouth, I should have kept it inside but I wasn’t thinking. I said “sometimes when I see him like this I think what if I smothered him with a pillow”.

My husband grabbed my arm and he just punched my in my left eye. It was so sudden. I fell and when I tried to get up he kicked me in my ribs. He told me “you say something like that to me again and you’ll really regret it”. I didn’t say anything. Then he told me to take his hand and I did, he led me to our bedroom and told me to go to sleep. He told me “I love you” but he hasn’t apologized. 

I did feel really sad, but it was like I was so sad I couldn’t even cry. But I cried this morning after I woke up and looked in the mirror. I have a black eye, and a bruise along my ribs. He left me roses and a note and after he came home from work, he’s been very nice to me. But I’ve been so quiet, I just kinda feel ashamed of myself and defeated. I don’t know what I’m going to do anymore. 

I just want to know, am I being naive for thinking like this? I know hitting is wrong, but I don’t blame him. I’m more upset with myself then him. I want to just forgive and forget, but maybe that is a wrong choice. Is this something I should move on from, or I am just being delusional?"
475,"When I was 14, I was cheated on by ""Susan"". I found out because a friend of mine, John, shared some screenshots of a conversation Susan had with some another guy from another class. I confronted Susan about it and she revealed that she had invited him over to her house several times, and things got steamy to say the least. 

When I heard the news, I felt my whole world crumbling down. I had been trying my best over the course of the relationship (11months\~), and knowing that she had sought someone else just pierced my heart. I couldn't believe it. 

Try as I might, I couldn't bring myself to end the relationship immediately. In fact, I think a part of me was also unwilling to give up the physical intimacy we once shared. Susan and I continued to have a very physical relationship, but I felt my love slowly dissipating over the months. Soon enough, I ended things. 

After Susan, I found myself looking for the next girl immediately. I wanted to feel something real and intimate. This continued, and till this day I've had flings and relationships that have all ended up in flames - probably due to my trust issues. In fact, my current girlfriend just ended our 2-year relationship and I'm desperately seeking for a new girl now. I just want to feel something, and I know its terribly unhealthy. 

I find myself constantly wondering what my partners are doing, and there's always an underlying fear that they'd betray me or do something wrong to me. I've become so possessive that I constantly have to know what they're up to and if I didn't know, I'd feel extremely anxious. I've adopted an unhealthy desire for my partner to update me about their activities or whereabouts as much as possible. I'd always need to feel a strong feeling of connection and intimacy with my partner or I'd start to freak out and doubt their intentions - which makes me extremely irritable and despicable.

Over time, I've just become a disaster of a human being. Possessive, insecure, bad-tempered, to say the least. I do understand that I am presenting myself as a terrible human being, but I hope that you guys refrain from any hateful comments..

What steps should I take to improve myself? How can I get over something that I've failed to get over for the past 7 years? What's wrong with me?"
476,"So,

I have been dating this girl for over 2 years now, we have an amazing realtionship, raerly fight and we are very close to each other.

Lately I came across one of her old friend's Facebook and I found that as a cover picture he has a picture where he is hugging her and touching her.

This sparked some pain in me, I tried deleting it off my mind but I just can't stand this.

I am not usually a very jealous person but this somehow hit me.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to understand if it would be okay for me to ask this dude to remove that picture from his Facebook or if I should maybe talk about it first with my GF.

The back of my mind is telling me that my ""request"" is somewhat irrational and I would look like a fool.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys and girls think?

Thank you for reading the post.

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: A guy has a picture of him hugging my girlfriend on his facebook and this somehow hit me hard."
477,"5 Days  ago: I informed my gf that I'm having doubts about the relationship, and did not want to plan things for the future. I said I was unsure of the relationship, but will not end it till I'm certain. She doesn't want it to end either.  

2 Days ago: It was my birthday and she spent $1000 on gifts for me.

I'm still uncertain about the relationship....

I feel like I have 2 options here: 

1. Keep the gifts and stick it out till I make a final decision
2. Just break up now, and return everything 

I'm poor on NYC standards, and her dad is a millionaire in NYC. I'm very biased to keeping the gifts lol"
478,"I need some tips because I came to the realization that I really need to dump my toxic af boyfriend \[20M\] for good.  The last time I tried to, he threw a tantrum.  Then before that, he blew up my phone's voicemail begging me to take him back (and then got his friends to convince me to come back).

&amp;#x200B;

So, how do I break up with him and mean it?"
479,"so if, one day she's over at my place, and i say ""Hey ______, i'm trying to decide whether I should confess my love to you over text or in person. What do you think?"" would that be like? smooth? corny? terrifying?"
480,"(I don't know if non-romantic relationships are allowed, sorry if they aren't. I'm also in high school and that's kinda important, I guess.)

It's a really stupid lie. But, we were just talking and he kept crying so I asked what's wrong. Then, he went on a tirade of everything wrong with his life. He then made a lie about killing someone. I thought that was weird. He lies about a lot of minor life points but that was very absurd to me. There's also been a lot of drama with this one girl who hugged him and, it was a hug, nothing more. But, he hates her for it. He's just been making it a daily task to make her life shitty. She's was dating one of his friends but he forced his friend to break up with her. He also took a picture of them kissing and spreaded it everywhere. He's also dating someone and he's made it his mission to have them hate her just as much. There's also me, and he keeps involving me in it and told me to confront her. Which I'm not doing. It's just stupid. Then, he got very angry with me saying I ruined his plan when I told her about it. I just don't get it. He seems very unstable and he gets upset over the smallest of things. There was also the substitute he threw a laptop at and then after that he got upset saying the substitute hated him because he's bisexual (I know, illogical). But, he's also one of my best friends and he's not that bad when you meet him. I just don't know what to do, I don't want to stop being his friend but he just seems unstable."
481,"My ex, let’s call him Ryan [37 when we started dating] , and I [22 at the time] were together for two years. It was a “May December” relationship and we had an age gap of about 15 years. I always looked up to him and we had a lot of fun learning new things from each other but we also always knew it would end after I finished grad school and moved and it did end (ironically?) in May. I didn’t find it hard to get over him since I always knew it would end. Not terribly long after, I started dating someone else, let’s call him Mark. We were dating throughout late July and made it “official” in mid August so it’s been just about two months. I really like this guy and we’ve hit a lot of milestones together but Ryan has a podcast that is seasonal and lately I find myself listening to it... and checking his social media pretty often. Im not necessarily missing him while I do it, I almost think it’s just out of habit from the last couple of years but I do know mark would be upset if he knew I was listening in. What do you guys think? Is this emotional cheating?

Sorry if this a stupid question :/"
482,"My apologies for how long this is, but I really need advice.

My bf &amp; I have been together 4 years &amp; we're expecting our first child. We both had gotten out of long-term, toxic relationships before getting together. This is the healthiest relationship we've ever been in before &amp; he's not the cheating type, which is a relief because my ex would cheat with anything with a pulse. But he has this pseudo cousin that makes me very uncomfortable.

The first 3 years of our relationship I met most of his family &amp; heard of ones I hadn't met yet. But out of the blue, a female ""cousin"" (they aren't related at all, apparently they grew up as if they were cousins since their parents were close, but there is absolutely 0 relation) of his that he hasn't spoken to in years added him on Facebook &amp; began messaging him CONSTANTLY. Like every single day, multiple times per day they would be talking all the time. She frequently vented to him about her husband that she was in the process of splitting up with. It really bothered me that I'd literally never even heard of this ""relative"" until 3 years in but my bf explained he hadn't even thought of her until she reached out to him. 

His siblings seem to see her as a relative but it bothers me that she's so close with him &amp; none of his other family in the same way. She talks to him about things you'd usually talk to another woman about. The other day she was venting about some guy she was messing around with &amp; how she felt like she ""was just a piece of ass to him"", like stuff you normally wouldn't talk to a male relative about. None of the messages are inappropriate besides the odd semi-tmi stuff like that, but I just get the weirdest vibe from her. It feels like she doesn't actually see him as a cousin &amp; she's prying for his attention a bit too much for my liking.

My boyfriend assures me he sees her as a blood relative &amp; that he only wants me, but he's previously been completely blind to women that hit on him. This ""cousin"" reminds me of an ole friend of his who used to constantly message him all day every day &amp; send pictures of herself (not nudes but several selfies getting him to say stuff like, ""You have an amazing smile"", just really attention-seeking) to him fishing for compliments. I made it clear I was not okay with it &amp; that she needed to stop. He insisted she was just being platonic &amp; that she had no interest in him, but I'm a woman too, I know exactly what she was doing. This ""cousin"" gives me similar vibes &amp; I can't explain why.

I admit I do consider myself to have ""relationship PTSD"" where as I'm so used to being cheated on &amp; abused that I'm constantly worried it'll happen even though I'm now in a completely healthy, faithful relationship. He's never been inappropriate with another person but like I said before, he's completely oblivious to women who are into him.

I initially thought this girl was a blood relative &amp; I still felt very strange about how often she talks to him &amp; the very personal things she discussed, but one day in passing it was revealed that they aren't actually related at all which increased my paranoia. I have a couple friends that I see as cousins because we grew up with close parents so I get that aspect, but there's no way in fucking hell I'd mention my sex life to them &amp; I don't message them all the damn time. I can't figure out if I'm just severely damaged from my ex or if this girl really has shady intentions. She has made no effort to befriend me at all except to add me on Facebook &amp; messaged me once asking about a previous TV experience of mine. Other than that she doesn't speak to me yet messages my boyfriend every single day. She's not close with other members of his family like she is with him.

I absolutely don't want to be that psycho girlfriend who sees every female in her boyfriend's life as a threat, but something just doesn't seem right about this girl. My boyfriend doesn't understand my concerns at all &amp; I feel dumb when I bring it up because he sees her as family but I'm convinced she has feelings for him, &amp; I don't like it. Am I crazy or are my instincts on to something?"
483,"My ex and I had been together for about 1.5 years. We broke up a few months ago because she wanted to move in together, and she told me she was ready to have someone who was more intertwined in her life, and I wasn’t quite ready for that next step. Shortly after we broke up, she changed her mind and came to the realization that she didn’t need to live together to feel satisfied with our relationship. She felt like it was stupid to give up on us over something like that, when it was going so well otherwise. I maintained that it was probably best to end things as I saw this as part of a deeper-rooted issue having to do with timelines based on our age difference.

I love her, and she makes me so happy. We always have a great time together, and are very compatible in many ways. We started hanging out again while broken up about a month ago for 2 weeks like nothing had happened, and both had an amazing time. However, at the end of that 2 weeks I broke it off again for the same reasons I did the first time. She sent me a message that my reasons were dumb and that she still wanted to be with me because she’s never loved anyone as much as me, and we make each other very happy.

Throughout our relationship, I always had doubts about our future together. While I love her and she makes me happy, I’ve always had a pretty clear vision for my life. I want to have my own kids one day, and I feel like there will always be pressure to settle down earlier than I’d like because of her age. I want to focus on my career and not think about marriage or kids until I’m into my 30s. If I stay with her, then by the time I’m 32, she’ll be 40 and it makes it that much more difficult to have kids. She’s made it clear that she doesn’t need to have kids to feel fulfilled in life and is willing to freeze her eggs to have a kid if I want that. She also says that she’s not in a hurry to get married, that her main goal in life is to be happy. However, I feel like societal pressure always has its way of creeping in. She had been asking about moving in together for at least 9 months prior to us breaking up. I worry that’ll still be on her mind a lot if we get back together. I also worry that, if she’s not exactly ecstatic to have kids now, and I want multiple kids in the future when it’ll probably be difficult to have them, that she’ll elect not to want them then.

There’s another element here that has to do with religion. While neither of us are religious at all, (both atheist), she grew up Jewish and I grew up middle eastern. I obviously don’t care, as I’ve been dating her, but it’s not exactly that simple. There are certain members of my family that wouldn’t want me marrying a Jewish woman (aunts, uncles, distant family, etc.). There’s also the issue of people back home in the middle east. If I were to take our future kids to the middle east, I fear they won’t be accepted, or they’ll feel the need to hide part of their identity. Having lived in the Middle East myself, that’s an experience I’d want my kids to have. I’m also very close with my family, and would hate to create tensions between them and I. I know that while my parents wouldn’t be outright opposed to it, it would still put a lot of pressure on them from family members and friends back home, and they’d prefer I find someone else. I could also see the possibility of myself moving back to the middle east one day, and I’m not sure how accepting they would be of her. I’ve never told her any of this, as it’s something that’s out of her control and would only upset her. I also don’t want the narrative to somehow get twisted and to be called a racist merely for trying to navigate the uneducated and intolerant nature of the socio-political landscape of the middle east.

There are times I’d like to follow my heart and live in the moment as she does (and tells me to do), and get back together with her. But, I’ve always been someone who logics himself through all life decisions. I don’t believe in soul mates; I believe there are plenty of people out there that I could end up falling in love with, having a great life with and starting a family with. My head is telling me that there’s a small chance we have a future together (not a 0% chance, but small). It’s also telling me that I could probably find someone many years from now when I’m more ready to settle down who’s younger, and won’t put me under the pressure of timelines and family tensions.

I’m not sure what to do. Some friends of mine tell me that I’m overthinking it and if she makes me happy, to just be with her, and that things will work themselves out. I don’t know if I’ll find someone who loves me as much as she does again. We get along great, communicate openly, and have never fought throughout the 1.5 years. Sometimes I feel like it’d be selfish of me to keep the relationship going if there’s just a small chance we end up together. She’s 33 now and still young, but her timeline for finding another partner and potentially having kids with them is closing. She told me that she just needs to know if there’s not a 0% chance, but I’m not sure I could deal in absolutes like that.

So reddit, what do you all think? Should I follow what my mind is telling me and end things now to avoid potential heartbreak, and so that she can find someone who’s more on her timeline while she’s young? Should I follow my heart and get back together with her and try not to worry about things that far in the future? Is it unfair to her to get back together knowing the chance of it all working out is small? She says we don’t need to make any big life decisions right now, and that I’m too focused on it. I don't want to keep having this debate in my head at every crossroad. Should I follow my heart and live in the moment and risk more heartbreak in the future?"
484,"I don't even know what to do. As the title says my life is a wreck, and I am terrified of... I don't know. Everything. This is gonna be a long one as there is a TON of backstory that needs to be given. I'm also not a grammar expert so don't rake me over the coals for it. 

My girlfriend and I met online online and got pregnant the second week we knew one another physically. 9 months later (jumping forward a bit) We had our son (just FYI I have never wanted children, I never planned for it, however I absolutely LOVE my son to death) and I felt depressed. Every little bit of my life was different, work was going terribly, and my partner and I were fighting every day. Communicating was failing, I was the only one working barely supporting us and not making any headway saving money. Everything for our son had to be brand new, nothing was safe enough, and without her wealthy family backing us we would have never of made it as far as we did (and I realize people with less have done more, and I respect them to no end) when my partner first moved to my city before our son was born she promised she was going to get a job, wanted to work, yet when she moved she didn't. She would claim she was insanely sick yet once I got home from work tired, sore, and just wanting to relax she would suddenly have the energy to go out to eat, to malls, to parks. It's not that I didn't want to do these things, but Jesus christ I was so stressed about money, the baby, everything I just wanted to sleep, which unironically was yet another thing we fought about. She wouldn't sleep when the baby slept, and at night before and AFTER the baby was born she'd stay up for hours on her phone, instead of just putting the phone down and closing her eyes. This continues even to present day. I tried to explain to her she needed to train her body that laying in bed meant it was time to sleep, which got me nowhere unsurprisingly, and she would get mad because I had to sleep for work (I was getting 5ish hours a night) and wouldn't be awake at night when baby woke up because she refused to pump, only wanted our son to breastfeed, and when she did pump our son wouldn't take a bottle and she'd get mad if I got up. Once our son was awake and then asleep. She'd go back to being in her phone. Furthermore she was absolutely adamant about being a stay at home mother yet absolutely wouldn't do much in terms of housekeep. I'm not saying she had to be the only one cooking, cleaning and whatnot, but she wouldn't do any of it (minus cooking. Admittedly she did cook all our meals) If come home and laundry wouldn't be done, dishes wouldn't be done, and would always complain about having to cook (she refuses to eat my cooking, and she was a chef at one point) and again, I'm not saying she had to do all the house work. You load the dishes into the washer, and I'll put them away, you start the laundry, I'll fold it and put it away Etc etc.

Anyways, as time went on we fought more and more, and went weeks without communicating. Our intimacy had all but fizzled and I don't even mean sexually. Just flirting and being a couple. I know she was recovering and even before the baby was born sexual things didn't feel... Fun. Because there was no romance, no passion. It was just get it over with and then done. Which after sex she wouldn't be able to sleep anyways, so it made it even worse, then later she'd accuse me of sexually repressing her or then sometimes wanting things too much. This also continues to present day. Anyways back on topic, I tried to be there for her and the baby but her CONSTANTLY tearing apart any social interaction we had, picking apart literally every single thing I did wrong and raking me over the coals with it, all I wanted was to be away. The entirety of our relationship she was in therapy, mostly for her family drama, stuff with exs, and her very intense judgemental dissecting every single social interaction we had... Ever. With friends, family, anything. It made going anywhere so unfufilling and not fun. Because I knew what was coming after we were done. She'd then accuse me of isolating her, though I gave her free reign of the car while I was at work. I could see her getting stronger with therapy, however she wasn't improving with us. Anytime something went wrong it was always ""You don't know how to be in a long term relationship"" because I disagreed with certain things she did/said. Literally every single disagreement or argument has this placed somewhere within it by her to me (which for the record her and I have now almost been together for 2 years, whereas my longest relationship was 5, and hers was 9, yet for those 9 years the relationship was (according to her) dead and she tried to end things with her ex multiple times for 6-7 years which end the end resulted in her dumping her ex, dating a new guy she met on a video game, and a week later moving in with him and getting pregnant, and having a miscarriage 9 weeks later caused by this new ex, THEN STAYING WITH THE NEW EX FOR A YEAR AND CONTINUING TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM, then dumping him and her dating me a month later) and nothing I say or do, no matter what point I make, gets through to her.

Anyways continuing forward, we fought and fought and fought, and when my son turned 3 months I just couldn't take it anymore. I know what I did was wrong, I know a lot of people might not agree with me, but I told her we needed to separate. I was so depressed, I could barely eat, anytime I got home from work I was counting down the minutes until it was bedtime and I didn't have to talk to her. Anywhere we went was AGONIZING because she always made things far more complicated than they had to be with the baby, an example would be we were given those baby changing mats, washable and whatnot, and instead of using those at the park and placing our son on it on the bench or table to do a quick change, she would instead have one of us (usually me) hold him straight up so she could change him, which made it incredibly awkward and uncomfortable and take far longer than it needed for the entire process, or instead of a quick 15 min trip to the store down the street. She'd want to load the baby up into the car, then unload him, take him out of the car seat (but bring it and the stroller) and then put him back in (which he HATED the car seat unless he was already in it) and when pointing this out I was the bad guy. Instead of one of us just quickly running to the store and coming him in that 15 min time frame it would turn into a 2 hour trip between diaper changes, taking baby in and out of the car seat, and the rest of it. Anyways back to the rest of it.


So when my son was 3 months old I just couldn't handle it anymore. I told her we needed to separate temporarily. It killed me. I knew I wouldn't see my son and I'd miss out on a MASSIVE portion of his first year of life. But I was losing my mind and nothing we were doing was healthy for anyone involved. Around Christmas time last year she literally criticized and tore apart (verbally and emotionally) my families Christmas party that we went to. It was her first Christmas away from her family, and she was used to more... Refined and fancy Christmas parties. Catered food and wine. My family had home grilled steak, some people were drinking and doing shots. People were laughing and having fun except for her. We left and she literally tore it apart and showed me how unappreciative and just... Judgemental and rude she could be. We fought and fought and she literally said she was going to harm herself. She got up screaming and ran out of bed (I have the texts saved of all of this after we calmed down and she admitted to it) with our son literally a foot away from her sleeping. I had to physically hold her down while she screamed for me to just end her, that she knows I wanted to, that she wants me to. I was in tears and in shock. I had to carry her out of the bedroom into our living room. We calmed down, fought some more, and then went to bed. This is ultimately what caused 90% of future fights, lack of communication, and just tore us apart and why I decided we needed to be apart. 

We split. In February. She went home and lived with her parents. I knew my son would be okay. She was breastfeeding, her parents she would be with understood and were extremely wealthy. She had a big family up there and both her parents were retired and were eager to help with their grandson that they originally were hardly going to get to see. In the time we were apart I was still working, paying all our bills, and going through therapy. Eventually going to therapy 4x a week. I saw no friends, played no video games, and any free time I did have was video chatting my daughter. I got sick a ton from stress, missed my daughter a ton and watched her first steps and words through a video screen, but accepted that this was my decision. I thought the time apart made us realize how much I did for her, and selfishly teach her what it was really like to be alone with a child instead of fighting with a partner constantly and making this the worst situation either of us have ever been in. Any fight we had I had to apologize for in the end which is still accurate to this day, I was always the ""the bad guy"" in any fight we had (most of the fights I started were because of money issues, as we were BARELY scrapping by and she insisted on shopping at places like Costco, getting mostly organic EVERYTHING which is far more expensive. Always wanting to go out to eat, and EVERYTHING for the baby had to be brand new. No hand me downs at all whatsoever. Thank God her parents have helped us so much with everything or... I have 0 clue how we would have survived with getting stuff for our child. Most of the fights she started were... Literally about anything else. I didn't do that. I did this. I did this but didn't do that. I felt I was blamed for EVERYTHING wrong in her life. 

After 7 months, we lived together again. I moved to her city this time. I gave up a job I've had for 10 years, I gave up friends, family, everything I ever knew that was familiar. This brings us to now... I've been here literally a month and... Jesus reddit I am just exhausted. I've been here a month and shit is just... Bad. Not even a week of being here and she ""broke up"" with me twice. Both over completely insane reasons. Once for not telling an old story at dinner, that wasn't even brought up naturally, and the second one was for the last 7 months of built up anger she has. She definitely holds a grudge against me for the last 7 months, and has undiagnosed and severe anger problems as well as post pardum depression, which time and time again and especially after every fight she brought up the last 7 months and how she was so alone (yet living off her parents dime? With her retired mother paying for everything and helping? Wtf?) granted our son wasn't sleeping through the night, but she also wouldn't go to sleep once he was down. She'd stay up playing on her phone. Always. On her cellphone. As time went on I took a job (the first one offered to me. I desperately needed money after moving) as a graveyard security officer and she got PISSED. In her eyes me working 930pm to 730am and sleeping till 1pm and waking up and spending time with the family, isn't enough for her VS working 7am to 5pm (and due to traffic getting home around 7-8pm) literally only seeing my child 3 days a week VS every day (I don't care about the amount of hours. I care about spending time with him every day.) and bringing it up CONSTANTLY. I am trying to explain to her my reasoning and she just doesn't get it. I moved here to work, to try to provide for my family. And right now we are both living at her parents and she's CONSTANTLY complaining about living here. What baffles me further is I want to do Corrections and that's just going to be more hell because it's more hours, manditory overtime, and further away. So how will things get better?! 

Hell once AGAIN she promised to work to help with building savings yet once AGAIN she didn't, saying she wants to spend the first 2 years of our sons life not working. If I made 100k a year I wouldn't care! However I don't! I do security and make like 40k a year. We live in one of the highest cost of living cities in the US. I can't support us by myself. Then she says wild things like how she wants to go to Japan in a year. How?! And how does she not see that as disrespectful to her parents? How do you live under someone's roof not paying rent and expecting them to help (and in her eyes getting furious when they don't) and then take a trip to Japan while you promise to be saving to move out and rebuild your life. Just... What? Unsurprisingly she treats her father like complete shit. Which in turn she then treats me like shit as well (not even for the same reasons)

Our sexlife is basically nonexistent. When she does want it, there is no passion. No foreplay. She just bends over and wants it done with. I try to tell her how I need a little ""help"" like a BJ or HJ or just SOMETHING to get me going and every single time she complains. She gets pissed when instead of cumming inside her, I do it somehere else like a towel or something. Anytime I want anything (which has gotten so bad to the point where I can't even ask for it or an terrified to) she refuses or gets so pissed it starts a fight. 

Not once in her life has she faced any consequences, hardship, or any real financial problems. Any person we see doing anything abnormal they are suddenly drunk or on drugs on her eyes, her and her family are so worried about how others in public sees their stature and they literally have no sense of humor, and because of this I can't be myself at all around her. Anytime I try to be goofy or silly she bashes me, and shuns me basically. Everything I do is wrong no matter how I play with my kid, how I joke, what I wear, my car. Nothing I do for my family is ever enough. Again I have nothing against stay at home mothers but she is CONSTANTLY complaining about having to do the very thing she chose to do. Always citing she has no help, that she does this ""alone"" and every argument we have she is ""alone"" no matter how much effort I put forth. She also gets ""annoyed"" that my mother who can't even walk due to a malpractice surgery, and was here the first week I moved here to see her and our son, needs extra help stating my mother was ""high maintenance"" because she needed assistance with her wheelchair. She's also CONSTANTLY bringing up the fact that my mother having been through two divorces is the reason I'm the way I am and the sum of all my ""complaints"" in our relationship. Completely ignoring that both those previous marriages were toxic AF and abusive and my mother had the strength to walk away and be strong enough to keep her kids happy and fed for 15+ years on her own. 

The worst part of this, she admits what she's doing is abuse, and understands her actions towards me are terrible, yet she continues to do it. Anytime I bring up therapy she always says she will look into it then doesn't. Then complains that it would take 30 minutes just to talk to someone on the phone, yet she's on her phone at LEAST 4 hours a day playing mobile games.

Tonight we got into a massive fight, about my work hours once again, which got worse with me leaving the house to get windshield wipers from autozone before it closed. Which she counted as ""running away from a fight"" and basically called me a coward. Yet we were literally sitting in silence for over an hour after our son was asleep AND I let her know I was going to leave 2-3 days prior to do this so..? During this she basically admitted to me once AGAIN in video chat how she was going to harm herself because I was trying to get ready at the office for work and couldn't instantly reply to her via text. I rushed home and found her sitting on the couch where I was just... Infuriated. I was done. I pointed out all the abuse. All the anger I had. How I had to basically bottle every single little thing I felt that I even got slightly upset at, because if I ever brought up anything it turned into a MASSIVE fight so in my brain it was just better to avoid every single fight possible. It's literally like navigating a minefield while driving a semi truck through it. I am emotionally and mentally terrified of my partner. I even suggested couples therapy and her speaking to a doctor about seeking help and was turned into the bad guy for even suggesting it. Mid fight (her mother had been there from the moment I was home and observed all of this) she threatened to harm herself once again and I said I was calling 911. I was tired of the threats and she needed help. Her mother LITERALLY TOLD ME NOT TO CALL 911 BECAUSE ""What will the neighbors think?"" Like wtf?! YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS HELP AND YOU'RE WORRIED WHAT THE NEIGHBORS WILL THINK?! She dialed the self harm prevention number TWICE and both times turned the entire fight about me and blaming on me, my PTSD, my mother having been through divorces, and me not knowing/understanding how to be in a long term relationship with someone or how to ""sacrifice"" 

I just... I don't know what to do. At the very end when we calmed down she started up again and said ""if I listed every single thing you did we'd be broken up by now"" and I lost it. I said this was over. I'm done being treated this way. I thanked her mother for all she had done for our son, us, and myself and said I'd be finding a new place to live, and I turned towards my partner and said I was coming at her with everything I have for our son. That I wouldn't take him from her completely but I refuse to be without our son in my life, and how despite all of this I STILL lose because at best in our state I'd get half custody and I'd only see my son on the weekends. I'd literally be missing out on a massive portion of his life, and how I know we wouldn't co-parent well. And how no matter what our son would be the one to suffer and he deserved done of this"" this unsurprisingly was INSTANTLY met with her saying she was going to harm herself and how she can't do this, and how she'd rather (selfishly) our child have one parent than two parents who are separated. Like what the fuck? How does someone even say that?!

I finally got her to calm down. Took back what I said... But... Reddit... I just don't know. I literally know NOBODY in this state. I can't afford to live by myself, I have no friends or family. I have no health insurance for 30 more days through my job and I feel trapped. A prisoner. I have no savings. I feel like I'm losing my God damn mind. If I leave she hurts herself and then I raise my kid without her, how do I explain that to my child if she did harm herself and we lost her? If I stay this will continue happening no matter what. No amount of therapy is going to fix this. I will become homeless. All my belongings, furniture, all are in her parents garage. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've ruined my life. I have nowhere to go and all I care about is being with my son. Please... What do I do? I know I'm not innocent in this and I have my own bad qualities I've brought to this but.. Ugh. She's threatened self harm so much to the point I have 0 clue if she's serious or not now, and if I leave and she does it I'm the bad guy and the reason she finally went through with it. If I stay then this cycle is going to continue. I have NO idea if this is how she was with her past partners either. I also don't want to fully take our son away from her (which wouldn't even happen, because I have little to no rights in this state for paternity VS her as far as I know, compared to the state I'm from which is FAR more progressive and where our son was born) because despite how she treats me, she is a good mother and has been AMAZING to our son. She also can provide more due to her family, they have purchased nearly everything for our child (the insisted and did it despite my request for them not to) and its a better ""family unit"" compared to just a solo father. And another terrible realization is every time we've fought she has ALWAYS freaked out on me and then the second someone else can observe it or she calls a self prevention hotline she's calm and telling a COMPLETELY one sided story, leaving out anything she did wrong and turning me into the aggressor, instigator, and villain, which just makes me more upset and my anxiety spike and then I'm looked at like the bad guy. 

At the end of it all her mother convinced her to seek couples therapy, and therapy for herself (I'm writing this the next day and she called nobody, but instead blamed the entire fight on my PTSD from the military and mentioned it multiple times to the operator she called at the self harm prevention number, and instead got info for them for ME to seek therapy instead???) the issue with this is we've already been through couples therapy after the Christmas incident, which wasn't working. Every time we went it basically started a fight (from her to me) right after because it brought up past fight stuff. So how is more couples therapy going to work if all we are going to do is fight more?! Like... There is no winning or anything with a positive outcome in this entire trash can fire of a situation. And in my eyes the person who suffers the most is our son, who's barely a year old and I JUST got back into his life. It tears me apart to even think of time away from him. As far as I know after the fight her mother takes her side but that's just me projecting, and I have no evidence at all of.

Even worse literally as I'm typing this at work (I've been working on this post since I got here) she's trying to argue more with me via text and I'm not responding because I just don't even want to deal with it or try to make things worse...  She doesn't even see or understand that I'm willing to even miss a major part of my child's life just to get away from her (the gf not the child) and still continues to force the relationship. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I fight a lot. Got pregnant and had son after 2 weeks of knowing each other. Split for 7 months. Got back together and fighting is even worse than before. Could become homeless. Feel trapped and alone and terrified. Can't afford my own place. I don't know what to do. Help. I really don't know how to TL;DR this one."
485,"I know the title sounds bad, but here it goes. I’ve been very good friends with this guy for a good while (we’re both teenagers) and we talk often. I’ve recently started dating his brother but he and I are still close and good friends. Now, I’m in Highschool still, and he’s a freshman in college about an hour away, and I want to visit him this Friday, but I don’t have a ride so I’ll have my sister(who’s a sophomore in the same college) drive me there on the way to work. However, she’ll get off late and would go straight home, and my mom can’t come and get me. Would I be in the wrong if I stayed the night with my friend in his dorm and then ride home with him the next day? Does this cross a line?"
486,"i needed a place to write this all down, ya know ""come clean"" so i guess"" ill start from the beginning. In late january i began dating this guy. Id known his sister for ages and met him my freshman year of high school. we hit it off quickly and pretty early on i developed a crush. We had both dated other people before this but the crush was mutual. anyways, we fell hard and fast. about a month in i said i love you and he didn't say it back. Understandable considering how young we are and how early the relationship was, but hurtful nonetheless. When i asked him about it afterwards (this was at prom) he said he was getting there but he wasn't ready yet. We dated for about three months before he broke things off with me on the last week of school. during exam week which, side note, who breaks up with someone before they're about to go take a final??? its been 5 months since it happened and about two months ago he started dating a new girl (no one from school follows this so I'm just gonna drop names) She's the half sister of a close mutual friend in a friend group i haven't really talked to since the dumping because i don't want to see him (the ex-boyfriend) while I'm still hurting. (another tangent sorry this is just a really long and complicated situation but the half sister and brother made out at a party once before they found out they were related, someone remind me to tell that whole story later) So erin and barrett begin dating and right off the bat i notice some differences between our relationship and this new one:

1. he gives her his jacket, subtle gesture but the absence of it is telling
2. he's said i love you
3. he's posted pictures of her

he's treated her way better than he treated me, but its so soon. we were all friends before this so i can't help but wonder if this was already going on before we broke up. all my friends tell me not to worry because I'm looking at it from the outside and i can't see everything, but i swear he never treated me like this. For context on the status on how our relationship ended, he admitted before breaking up with me that he had thought about it for a while, and had come to the conclusion while we were on vacation together that he wanted to break up with me (which confuses me greatly because that trip has some of the happiest memories of our relationship attached to it) we both kinda talked sh!t about each other after the breakup (it was bad) (also I'm new here so idk if I'm allowed to swear) but i never truly hated him and to tell you the truth I'm still in love with him. I know for a fact that its not mutual but i can't help but hope for the day when he turns around and realizes that i was the one the whole time. i just wonder why i wasn't enough, you know like maybe i was too needy, or too picky, or not pretty enough (erin is suuuuuuper skinny and tall and I'm a lil thick and extremely short) and she's younger. i just have all these thoughts and insecurities and sorry if none of this makes sense, feel free to ask me anything below, I'm an open book. any advice for someone young and in love with someone who doesn't want me back?"
487,"TLDR; My crush and I are now Friends with Benefits but the way he acts is Boyfriend-spec and is confusing the hell out of me... Can FWB be purely non-romantic or is it usually boyfriend-y vibes? Should I continue to quietly pursue my feelings or let it go?


BACKSTORY; So, I met this guy around 2 months ago, and I knew when I met him he was totally my type and of course I caught feels, I couldn't stop thinking about him. 

Our first meeting was pretty weird, our mutual friend(1) enticed him to show me 'The Receipt' which was a bank statement with an absurd amount of money on it for an 18 year old, not really caring I commented: ""Why the fuck are you showing me this?"" which he says was a reaction he'd never gotten before.. 

2 weeks pass and I go out to a street racing event with a girl friend and her mates, absolutely shitfaced, I texted him asking him to bring his car and hang out (at this point we were ~1.5 hours away from his house from driving). Reluctant at first, he quickly realised I was super intoxicated and asked when I would be going home, to which I replied: ""I'll go home if you say so, so come out, okay?"" He quickly agreed and he came out with another of our friends(2) in their street cars. I wobbled over to their cars when the meet moved locations and literally collapsed onto his side as they were messing around under the hood and began greeting and hugging everyone after which he said: ""Once we look at this boost leak I'll take you home, hm? You drank too much..."" Even grabbing my side when I tried to walk away once, nevertheless I was intoxicated and think I stumbled a bit, which could mean he was purely just not wanting me to fall..?

I dont remember too much of the rest of the night but he was a total gentleman, helps me deal with a toxic ex at the same event who followed us on the motorway, made sure I've gotten my shit together before sleeping, even getting up early to make sure I eat and shower before work (I start at 5:00AM), when I woke up my heart fluttered remembering the night before.

Not even 4 days later, I'm quietly drinking away my depressed-ass over this unrequited crush and call our friend(2) asking him to come hang out and when my crush asked him where he was going and he said to my house, my crush called me and asked me if I wanted him to come, obviously I couldnt resist and said yes. Later that night we go for a drive, he blows his transmission and I idiotically confessed I liked him, he responded with: ""I know, I'm not ready for a relationship again yet"" (his last gf was 2 years ago...)

That night we smashed, and he continued to stay for Friday through to Tuesday afternoon when he had work that night. It was the best and worst time of my life, my heart literally wouldnt have been able to take anymore. 

He was super sweet during the 4½ days, affectionately kissing me and doing things a boyfriend would do, it was literally the biggest bait ever and I told him to stop but he says it's not intentional.. Before he left I asked for a kiss, to which he obliged and commented: ""You are the biggest tease..."" Like ?!?!? 

My girl friend tells me she definitely thinks he's into me, but the way he acts and the words that leave his mouth are totally different... I dont know how to feel or what to do! I don't want to get myself hurt by not listening but if I turn away from these feelings and he was just unsure of his right now I'd be so conflicted if I met someone else...

Please help me RA Users!!! 😭😭"
488,"I’ve been seeing this girl (22F) for about 4 months. Things are rocky atm, she’s going through some tough stuff and so am I. But today, I’m really feeling it. I’ve been crying for the majority of the day, and I really just need a hug from someone I care for right now. All my friends are obviously busy with work, and my mom doesn’t come home until midnight. I just feel like it may be a bit weird, being that vulnerable with someone I’m not officially dating. We’ve had heart to hearts before, but I’m usually the one who’s stood strong this whole time. I just don’t know how to phrase it. Because I know talking about it won’t help. A hug will. I just need one right now. 

UPDATE: I reached out like you all recommended, and I unfortunately was not able to see her. She had just arrived from the Hospital where her cousin was, and still is, in a coma. So I said I understand, and that it was best if she was with her family for tonight. She said she felt bad, and asked if we could get coffee the next day after 5 PM.  Even though I really needed someone last night, she also needed to be with her family last night. So i'm seeing her later today, and we'll see how that goes.  

TL;DR
Been seeing a girl for 4 months. Not official yet. Would calling her, saying I need her company and a hug, deter her from seeing me more in the future?"
489,"My friend recently told me she is transgender and has started to dress like a girl. I am on the football team but usually hang out with my friends I play video games with. When they saw me with her, they would make fun of me at practice, and so I stopped hanging out with her at school, and he texted me that it was upsetting.

What should I do?"
490,"So my boyfriend has a roommate. His roommate has a girlfriend. They share a dorm and the other girlfriend and I spend many nights there. We all were hanging out one night when his roommates girlfriend decides to change with all of us in the room? If it was just her and I, I wouldn’t mind. I really like her, but I’m mad she changed in the same room as my boyfriend? I usually go to the bathroom to change out of respect to her and her boyfriend. (they’re in a suite so the bathroom is literally in the same room) She stripped down to her underwear. My boyfriend said maybe she forgot to go in the bathroom.. but that doesn’t happen. Again I really do like her, we’ve got along just fine, but I think it was a bit disrespectful to change in front of my boyfriend. I just want to feel validated in this because I know I can be a bit insecure sometimes and I want to know if it’s okay to ask my boyfriend to talk to his roommate about it. I just don’t like the idea and it makes me wonder if this happens when it’s just them in the room. (Sometimes one of them has class and we are stuck with the others boyfriend)"
491,"I was on abroad for my studies so I was alone in my place I quickly sympathized with a girl and I knew it just friendly and I made her understand.
One time she was really tactile with me and I and I pushed her back.
I stopped to speak with her couple of time.
One time I was in a bad mood and she call me for eat just normally so I accepted and we finished the day in her house, she started to be tactile and I did not resist we slept together.
When a comeback to my country, my girlfriend saw this girl on my social network, she follow her on, and the girl who I slept, said we slept together...
Now my girlfriend don’t really want to talk with me and it’s normal but I need advise for don’t lose her can you help me?

we had been together for 2 years"
492,"Well I really love her, but in the last 2-3 years, I have suffered a few things that may have changed the way I interact with people, I'm kind of a 'cold' person and having moments of social anxiety.

The thing is that I used to talk and hang out a lot with her, watch movies and have normal best friends interactions, like hugging or care about each other. But right now, I don't feel like doing these things, like calling her to just chat or hang out, or ask her about her week or how is she, and I know she must be feeling kind of bad or confused with the way I'm being with her, but I really don't feel like doing those things.

I've been thinking a lot about this, about my attitude and the WHY about this. Sometime I've got the feeling that maybe I started to love her in a more romantic way, and for avoiding that, I began to have this behavior (that is not justifiable).

Also, I realized that I have to improve this, or I will lose her, which I don't want to, so I started to push me to call her and organize some hang outs, but those things resulted as kind of awkward moments, because of my lack of feelings.

So I need some advice and help to start recovering my relationship with her, I know that I have to talk this things with her, but I don't really know how to approach this thing.

What I have been doing lately, is regularly talk to her, ask her basic things, and try to get into a deeper chat, but our conversations have like 4-5 turns max :/

Thanks in advance for your advice.

I haven't been able to organize my ideas, so the post is a little bit messy."
493,"So I’m just hurt . A month ago my ex (26m) -let’s call him R - broke up with me . So much went on . But basically it’s this . When we got together it had been like 8 months since he got out of a 5 year relationship. They basically hurt eachother a lot , cheated etc. Then he gets with me . We weren’t exclusive and he let me know that if anything happens with a guy to let him know . So I’m still friends with my ex at that time , I tell my ex about him and my ex kisses me . I kiss him back instinctively but pull away quickly . I feel bad so I tell him . And he’s hurt , he has reason to be . We agree to take it slow , and he says he forgives me . We start being an exclusive thing . And our relationship is good and happy . But then months later he brings it up again , and says stuff like why do I still have him on social media and what not so I delete everything of my ex . I have 0 contact with him anyways.  And R says he didn’t really forgive me but that this time he does .  I really do love R .. and we move on . But our relationship starts spiraling after 6 months of being serious . And he says that he can’t be with someone who did that to him . So he breaks up with me . After a day he comes back and says he wants to give it a shot because he loves and I agree . Now 8 months in , and I see my Ex at an event , now me and my Ex have the same bestfriend so it’s normal that we see eachother but we never speak just say Hi . I take a group photo with my ex . It’s posted , I untag myself . And R sees that I liked it even tho I have no memory of it . And he insists that I always talk to me Ex that I’m a liar . And that he didn’t forgive me . And now we’re finished . And I’m hurt . Because am I even allowed to feel like this ? Like is it okay for me to feel hurt even tho I cheated ? I hate that he said he forgave me then turns out he didn’t . And I feel like maybe he’s projecting and he’s not over his ex . He’s not over what she did to him . He even told me during our relationship that it still hurts him . Reddit I really don’t know what to think .."
494,"I will try to make this short, but a girl I liked who transferred back home for a semester will be back in the spring. We hung out a lot over the summer. and had a good time. So when classes started and I didn't hear from her I asked my roommate what had happened. She ended up transferring a semester to be with friends from home. So every now and then my roommate who is family friends with her family, will get a call from her.  She always ask to talk to me, and says she misses me. She had said several times that she misses me and that she had recently watched a movie that related to when she was here, and it reminded her of a movie she invited me to see with her. She also stated that It'd be funny if were to ask my family to have Thanksgiving with my roommates family because they are all family friends. She asked if I missed her, and I replied that I did and it was boring with out her here. This all happened recently but I had to go take an exam so I didn't get to finish the call with her. If she does come back in two months, what should I do? How should I proceed. I could see myself in a relationship with her, but that would be her decision. I have been missing her and wish she was here but if she comes back I would like to let her know I'd be interested in a relationship. So what should I do if things go according to plan."
495,"So, basically me and my friend are going to this girl’s house tomorrow, and we’re gonna watch a couple movies, and while we’re all sat together, and after the movie, I need a plan on what exactly to do"
496,"So this will be a bit of a longer post. As the title says I’ve been talking to this girl for a few months now. I’d say roughly 4 months and things have gotten pretty serious. We work in the same place, but don’t see each other every second of the day. Insight to that we work inside of a jail. Anyways we hangout a good amount, seem to Always make time for each other. Whether it be movie nights after work or just going and doing something before work. We are constantly at the gym with each other to better our careers and that’s kinda where the Romance started. We were friends for a good minute then started talking. We are 4 months in and things are pretty serious. Like I said before, but I’ve asked her to make it official I think twice now and she says we basically are, but she just doesn’t like putting labels on things. Mainly due to the fact that she was in a long term relationship prior and was in the process of getting married. So I can kinda understand it. Well things are about as normal as anything else, but she doesn’t really open up very well. She’s working on opening up more and I’ve seen good progress, but there are days that she just doesn’t talk about anything. Says she’s fine and that nothing is bothering her, yet I know that there is. She talks about getting away from the town we live in and just getting away from everything. This is a pretty constant thought for her. Everyone at work tells me to just cut my loses and end whatever it is we have because she obviously doesn’t want to be in a relationship she’s just keeping me around, but I really feel like she will be committed at some point. 
Also to add, her best friend is gay which isn’t a big deal to me, expect for the fact that I’m pretty sure they might have had a thing prior to me talking to her. Whenever we don’t hangout she’s normally at her house staying the night and such. I have brought it up a few times and she says that they are just friends. I’ve asked if her friend knows about me and she said she does, but she doesn’t know we are “talking” because she likes to keep her personal life private. But to me that just seems weird. Just not really sure what to do. Tonight we were at the gym and she was fine for a good minute, but then reached for her phone and her attitude changed instantly. The rest of the workout she was constantly looking at her phone texting and I didn’t think anything of it, but then when we go to leave she didn’t talk to me in the slightest. Something was bothering her but I didn’t try to pry. We hugged and kissed goodbye and she got into her car and basically sped off like she had something better to do. All in all I’m just overall confused and need some advice. She isn’t the type to really talk about her feelings and show a lot of emotion so I can understand that. Just looking for some outside advice! Thanks!

Edit: I did forget to mention around two months into talking I asked if she wanted to make it official and she said she wasn’t ready, I respected that and basically ended things all together. Well that lasted about a week and we started talking again like nothing every happened. Recently I asked again to make it official and she said in time we will be together."
497,"This sounds weird I know, and I probably shouldn't be upset about it but I am.

Throwaway because my bf has an account and follows me on it.

My boyfriend and I have been together over a year and a half (we also live together), and recently-ish (like last few months) he's started seeing an uncle he's pretty close to every week. Which is great because he loves his uncle and enjoys hanging out with him. But, I asked if I could come along sometimes and he always said no. He said he wants to go alone, he wants only alone time with his uncle; which I can understand but he gets to see him every week. I just want to come along every now and then since I don't know this uncle very well and I'd like to be closer to his family. But he's stood by his big ""no"".

It kinda bugs me? It feels like he doesn't want me to be a part of it. Like he just doesn't want me there.

We made a deal that if I started making friends that I could spend time with (because a big reason was because I don't have anyone to hang out with) then he would let me. I made a lovely friend and we went out to Starbucks; my part of the deal fulfilled, and they're wanting to watch a movie I've been wanting to see next week so I said I'd like to go to that. Now he's acting a bit distant about it and I feel like he still won't let me go. He seemed pretty adamant about not bringing me along before and I don't think he's changed his mind.

I dunno, I just feel really bad. We've had so many discussions about it (before our 'deal') but I still never get to go along. I just feel really bad about it all. I don't know what to do or how to feel. It just feels strange that he refuses to let me come along.

What do I do? I just need some kind of advice on this. I don't think my feelings are justified but it still hurts my feelings(?)

*

*EDIT: the reason that deal was made was because i mentioned that i haven't made any friends i can hang out with in california so i've been kinda lonely and bf took that as the reason i want to go so bad. we made a deal that if i make a friend that i can hang out with regularly i can come with him to see his uncle once.

i had a conversation with him where i kinda berated him about never letting me go and i made the assumption he wouldn't let me go see the movie with them. he got quiet, told me i was being an asshole and that he was planning on taking to his uncle about me coming along, then told me he was going to the room to be alone for a bit. he usually wants to think when he gets upset so he doesn't explode or anything like that. i come into the room after around 30mins to check on him so we can have a conversation, and he decided to go to sleep. now i feel crappy and i can't sleep."
498,"Ive been with my girlfriend for 4 years now. We met in college and things were great for 3 years but I think the relationship has ran its course. I’ve tried to get past the flaws I see in her but after we work through them they just resurface or something else just as annoying comes along. I’m not perfect either and I’m well aware that many of our issues are my fault but I’m just not sure it’s worth the effort any more. Anyway, that’s not the point of this post.

We’ve lived together for 1 year and 4 months now after graduating college. We split the rent although I cover a majority of the other expenses. It’s a nice (and probably overpriced) apartment in the city where we went to school which is about 20 minutes from my (recently divorced) parents houses and I have plenty of close friends In the area from college and my home town. She grew up a few hours away so she had no family in the area and has alienated herself from all friends she had in college (huge source of our problems but that’s besides the point as well).  

I’m very flexible with my living situation assuming we do split. I have a good job that lets me work from home. I could crash with friends/parents for a few weeks or pay her share of the rent for a few months if needed. She is a resident and makes OK money but no where near enough to live on her own within a reasonable distance to the hospital she works at. We really can’t break the lease (6 months left) on our current place as the fine is so high it likely wouldn’t be worth the hassle. We had a fight last year where we almost ended things and she said she wasn’t willing to cooperate with the logistics or fees of breaking the lease, moving, etc. so I don’t expect her to be much help in this area.

Basically, I want to break this off and offer a solution to our housing situation that’s fair to both of us. I’m not going to sugar coat it, she’s totally screwed if I break up with her. She’ll have no one to crash with and not enough money to live on her own unless her parents help. While her housing situation really isn’t my problem I do love her and don’t want to totally devastate her financially. Here are a few options I came up with but would love some feedback or other options from those on the outside looking in.

1. Continue to split the rent with her after we break up with her having the apartment for the first 3 months and me taking the last 3 months. I’ll move in with parents for a month, friends for two months. This would give her time to find a place and adjust. I’m afraid that once she moves out she’ll stop paying her half of the rent. I could ask her to pay the full rent for the 3 months she lives there and I’ll cover the full rent the 3 that I’m there but I don’t know if she would cooperate or if she could afford it.

2. Ask her to move out as she won’t be able to afford the apartment by herself. Give her one month to figure out her plans while I stay with one of my parents. Either sublease a room to a friend, cover the bill myself, or see if the building management will let me move into a smaller unit without paying the fine.

3. Pay the full lease break fee and beg management to cut us a break. I move in with one of my parents till I find a new place and I have no clue what she would do. I would probably be stuck paying the full fee to break the lease. She could afford it but, knowing her, will be stubborn.

I could use any help I can get. Let me know if you think you have a solution or need some more details.

After writing all of this out I realize how fortunate I am to be flexible with my work/living situation. Though, I don’t see any good option to set her up for success after we split. She has some very childish tendencies and is very stubborn when we argue so regardless, this is going to be a nightmare. Plus, I hate confrontation.

Side-bar: am I overthinking this and just need to end it already and work the details out later? It’s keeping me up at night and i feel like I’m half in half out of the relationship. I’m going to miss her a lot she was a huge part of my life but at the same time I’m excited to get more time with friends and meet new people."
499,Unsuccessfully trying to achieve that bubble butt but apparently I just happen to have more skinny body type. Getting really depressed about it and sometimes question myself why would he even marry me when his ex was so freaking hot. P.s. suffering from low self esteem yes
500,"We were in the same school for quite a bit, and during that time I had a HUGE crush on her (my 14-15 year old brain thought it was love), we talked sometimes and by sometimes I mean rarely. I know I may look like a creep, but I was too shy to actually talk to her. I had to move to an all boys high school (3 years) and during that time I got new friends and I felt a lot better about this (mostly because I didn't have time due to the studying I had to do). By then I knew that I was foolish and I just wanted to be friends with her or something similar. BUT I keep dreaming about confessing my feelings to her, and it ends by rejection (I have dreamed many times about saving her from falling off a cliff, and saying that I love her and then she jumps off again... ouch). The last time I saw her was at the official exams (at the end of high school, students do the same final exam but in another school), and guess what, I was still too shy/coward/(insert synonym) to talk to her. And today, I just woke up after dreaming about talking to her in the same school where we were, and she was like ""ok"" and she changes the subject. I can't let her haunt my dreams, help me. (Also I have never fantasized about her, I tried but I couldn't). Sorry for the long post."
501,"I'm currently talking to a gal from my home country. I'm in the US and she is in Europe. I'm definitely head over heels for her and she is too. We've talked about taking things to a more serious level. I can't say we've had any doubts, but we do have concerns on how we can keep things going. Immigration isn't an issue; she will be coming here soon with an education visa, so the distance is really only a temporary bump in the road. We do talk, very often. But I do also want to make it more understandable that I'm in this and that I'm 100% serious. 

How did you all handle your temporary long-distance situations? What would you suggest in a situation like this? Love stories of encouragement would totally be awesome to hear!"
502,"So the title says pretty much the summary of the situation. We didn't get in a big fight or a conflict, no, everything is perfectly fine and things are how it's supposed to be. Except for this whole thing.

What was happening was recently he's always been sent to the office and to detention and gets in-school suspensions and stuff because on how he's been treating his teachers lately. He disrespects them a lot, cursing loudly with them in the room and talking shit about them, which is so not cool, I know. And honestly now that it's getting worse because he got suspended at school for two days and is now grounded by his parents. I don't know what to do since we're in a long distance situation at the moment, but I'm really concerned about how he's behaving lately. I can't talk to him for a while either since they took his phone. I just heard about this from one of our mutual friends. The last text he sent me was: I got suspended at school for the next two days and will probably be grounded for a while, I'm really sorry and I will explain everything to you when I get back. I made a poem for you to read in case you miss me. Love you.

I want to call him as soon as he gets his phone back and let him explain and tell him that he seriously needs to change his attitude towards his teachers. Do you think that it's the right thing to do?"
503,"Apologies for formatting as I’m on mobile. 

My best friend (28F) and I (28F) have been friends for nearly a decade. She and her fiancé (25M) have been together for four years and are due to be married in about 2 months. 

At the bachelor party, the groom made out with the beer cart girl from the golf club the guys played at after inviting her back to their house. The events of the bachelor weekend came to light after one of the groomsmen told his wife about the situation, who then told the bride. 

When we (the bride, myself, and the wife of the groomsmen) heard about these events, we were shocked. The groom has NEVER done anything like this so long as we’ve known him. He’s never even given me a sliver of suspicion. 

The bride, the groom, and myself have been thick as thieves since they began dating. I ended a long term relationship about 3 years ago, and they supported me so much, and we often find ourselves hanging out, just the three of us. This has never been a problem. The only issue that has arisen is that the bride, and my best friend, often comes to me to complain about her bf/fiancé. As a friend typically does, I validate her complaints most of the time, but have never uttered a word about them breaking up. I have always supported them together, and even suggested meeting with couples counselors for these issues. 

When the cheating at the bachelor party all came out, my best friend wanted space to figure things out with her fiancé. In the meantime, the wife of the groomsmen (whom I mentioned above) and I were in close contact regarding the situation. I am staunchly opposed to lying/cheating/gaslighting and I personally would have ended things, and the wife agreed with me. I never outrightly said that to the bride, because she never asked for my advice. I only said to do what her heart told her. 

After about 10 days, the wife, who is a close friend of mine, met with the bride and groom, along with her husband, to discuss everything, including stating that the wedding would proceed on as planned. During the convo with these two couples, the groomsman and his wife essentially repeated all the texts and thoughts/actions of mine regarding this situation during the time my friend wanted space. 

I said things along the lines of: 

 “I don’t know how her dad could walk his daughter down the aisle to a cheater”

 “I would sell the house [they bought together] and move back home to sort things out”. 

“he and his family had better pay for the deposits on the venue”

 “he will probably catch on fire when he walks into church” (we are Catholic). 

I also drove by their house one night, with the encouragement of the other wife, to see whose cars might be at the house, essentially trying to suss out if they were both staying at their house since the bride had been keeping us in the dark. 

These were regrettable, to say the least. I would have NEVER said them knowing that it would get back to the bride and groom (a lesson I’m still learning as I get older) and they were fueled purely out of anger. I truly feel awful I said these things, and I let my emotions get the best of me. 


The bride and groom sat down with me and confronted me with all this. I was shocked and stunned that my other friends would throw me under the bus in a way, and repeat all these things, particularly because they don’t have clean hands either. I admitted and apologized profusely for my words and actions, and I genuinely feel terrible that I hurt them. I love them both so much, and at the end of the conversation, we all hugged and said we loved each other and they forgave me. I was angry about being confronted, but I did fuck up, and it felt good to have them forgive me. 

In the following days, I was completely ignored by these two women. Wouldn’t text me back, wouldn’t call me back, I was so confused. So I called the bride on Monday and we texted, and I said I missed my best friend and I was hoping we could hang out. Tonight, she texts me saying that she’s still struggling with what I did and said - essentially taking back the forgiveness she gave me, and that her and her fiancé want to meet again to discuss. 

I feel like I’m being made to be the pariah in this situation because they need someone to blame for all this negativity. This couple is dead set on getting married, which I completely support, because I love my best friend and this is what will make her happy. Because I am conveniently the runner up to the cheating fiancé in regards to poor character, the anger surrounding all this is landing on me. Now, I’m afraid of what I’m going to walk into and I don’t know what else I can do or say to make it clear that I made a horrible judgement call and that I am truly sorry, while maintaining a spine. 

TL;DR: said some nasty things about my bff’s fiancé because he cheated on her. They’ve chosen to stay together but they know all the shit I said, and are now saying they’ve changed their minds and no longer accept my apology. How do I approach round two of being raked over the coals when they previously forgave me for what I did/said?"
504,"First time posting here and I could just really use some outside perspective. We have been dating since highschool and have always had fun together. During this time, we have grown a lot as people and I have been a bit more ambitious with my career and have experienced some success while she has been on a steady career path.

We have never been a perfect couple (not that I expect us to be) but it seems like the small fights keep happening and increasing in intensity and our attitude to each other has been getting worse. We were at breaking point about 5 months ago where we acknowledged we need to really work on somethings (separately and together). Things like communication, how happy we were, stress levels, expectations on one another, sexual intimacy and romantic gestures. 

While all of these things have improved over the past 5 months, I still don’t feel like we have made it to the ‘level’ that we need to continue (not expecting perfection but want us to be happy). 
I feel like ultimately the breaking point 5 months ago has taken a massive tool on me and I don’t know if I can recover.

With the pressures of marriage and kids, I just don’t know if this relationship is the one OR am I throwing away such a good thing right now. I have not an indecisive guy but I have never been this confused or unsure. 

My girlfriend thinks we are in a better place than this and is not having doubts about our future together"
505,"A little backstory. My ex started to grow distant for a few weeks, like not showing up to pre planned dates,  not wanting to meet my friends. before I had gotten too drunk and her words ""got too handsy"" and left me passed out on my couch before heading to another guy's house, which I have never done when blackout before according to all of my other ex's and friends. And the other people that were drinking with us said that nothing happened. And she spent time at this other guys house for a few times after I gotten too drunk, I apologised for me behavior and promised to never drink around her again, and she said it was fine and wasn't relationship ending. But I come to find out that she's spending more and more time with the other guy, bringing him to her parents house having dinner, spending time with him. All while I thought we were still together. Would you consider that she cheated on me? Or was it never really a relationship, even though she had said yes to being my girlfriend?"
506,Myself and this girl had been texting and calling for a while now. During a weeklong schooltrip she spent most of the night in my bed and we kissed for the first time. I'm really crazy about her and she spent the night at my place the other night. The problem is that she is a Muslim and I'm not. This means that her parents wouldn't condone us being together. Her dad would kill her if he found out she had a boyfriend let alone one who isn't a Muslim. I really like this girl and I want to try but to me part of a relationship is meeting the other person's parents. It's fine for now because we haven't been together for very long but I think it will bother me in the future. I could use a fresh opinion on the matter from an outsider. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
507,"Someone please be here for me. I’m losing my mind.

I don’t get it. I don’t think I’m that much of a bad person, but I feel like I’m constantly the one who gets hurt. I know I am a stubborn and selfish person, and I’m trying to work on that. 

Thursday afternoon, my partner told me his friend got shot and is dead. When I came to pick him up, I wasn’t sure what to do. I didn’t give him a hug; I didn’t ask him how he is. Instead, I asked about the funeral while eating a chocolate bar as I had nothing all day. My partner told me he didn’t want to talk because I wasn’t interested or cared. That upset me, instead of taking his perspective into consideration, I got angry because I am sick and tired of him constantly talking about how no one is there for him, when his family members and I have bent our back for him. 

This escalated because I was being stubborn, instead of actually listening to him and seeing where he was coming from, I lashed out. I have anger issues and it escalated. The next day, on Friday, when it was night time it got worse. We couldn’t talk to each other, and it made me even more angrier. Saturday night came along, he said he was going to visit his friend’s family. He went away for two hours. He then told me that his friend who joined him stained the back of the car and needed to clean it up on Sunday. We sorted things out on Sunday; I apologised for my selfishness and wrong doing. I saw the stain, it was tiny, but my mind was suspicious. Is it really possible for a fucking white glazed donut to come out of its bag and stain the backseat of the car. 

Monday night comes along. My partner showed me the snapchat his ex sent, which stated: “So you pretend to break up with your girlfriend, twice, just so you can sleep with me. Then blocked me.” But my partner replied “You’re the one who blocked me. You’re starting shit, saying shit and then blocking me and then taking a screenshot.” I gave it an hour before I messaged her and asked her what the fuck is going on. Then she stated that they had sex on the Saturday night and that they had sex months ago after she got her hair done. She claimed she messaged him and took the screenshot because she was gonna show me. But I feel like she was never going to show me because she would have showed me before I messaged her. I didn’t want to believe her, but then she said “How would I know about his mate and how would I know he can finally drive by himself if he didn’t come to me?” I asked her what car was he driving, or where did they have sex. She didn’t tell me. She told me to ask him. She sounded so smug. I asked where the fuck did they have sex - if she said the car then it would make sense of the stain, but she refused to tell me. The first time she claimed they had sex was debunked - she claimed they had sex while he finished work. Then I said, “Okay, when because I’ll ask his workmates.” Then she gave a nervous laugh, asking why would I ask his workmates. Because they’d tell me the truth - they respect me. Then she said they had sex after he was closing up from work after she had her hair done, which I know when she had her hair done because it was posted on the salon’s social media. It was a lunch time and I always pick my boyfriend up from work when he finishes and he always comes out straight away on the dot. She then blocked me because I saved the text chat of the things she was messaging me. 

My partner states it’s not true, that she’s just starting crap. It’s not the first time she’s got in the way of things. I’ve dated my partner for two years, nearly three. And she has constantly been making fake accounts of both of us and harassing me. And then pretending it’s not her. We’ve had the same fight last year about how he needs to drop contact with her because she’s been nothing but a horrible person. 

My partner came clean, told me that he confided in her. I saw the call log. He called her on Saturday night a few times. I am upset and angry, why did he message her to confide with her if he was spending time with his friend’s family and friend. I don’t know who to believe. My partner has lied to me before. He says he’s a changed person. That if he really wanted to cheat on me, his ex would be the last person he’d go to, that he’d go to someone like a girl he slept with while we were on a break last year. Who the fuck do I believe? My mind is going fucking crazy. I want to believe my partner, that he only told her about what happened. But we had this same argument last year to stop telling her crap. She’s an ex, a horrible ex, and she should be kept  in the past. He wouldn’t like it if I confided in my ex, so why can he do what he did. He can apologise all he wants for what he did, but he broke that trust again. But surely, no one would be that low to lie about a friend’s death. But would she be that low to lie about having sex with him?  I know she’s psycho from all the fake accounts and harassment, but could someone really go that low.

I know what I did,  not being there for my partner in a time where he really needed someone, is a horrible thing. And I feel so guiltily and have been feeling like utter crap for the past few days because of it. Sometimes I think she’s finally got the leverage, that she finally knew something about him which she could make up a lie to ruin me."
508,"It’s my (18M) first long term relationship and I feel it coming to an end. I’m in a sort of emotionally rough patch right now and so I feel as though I need a huge amount of support. My gf(18F) however, has a life outside of me, I know and respect that and don’t want to hinder that in any major way. That being said I think I’m gonna crash if I keep waiting for support that might not be there.

I still lover her, and I hope she still loves me but it just feels like a dead end. I don’t want to break up with her but I also don’t want to be locked in a support limbo that I can’t reasonably resolve without hurting her life. What do I do/say to get a “it’s not you it’s me” cliche off when I genuinely mean it."
509,"Sorry for the confusing title, but I’m confused too.  The situation isn’t really all that difficult to understand. My wife and I have 4 kiddos between us, 2 girls with her and 2 boys with me.  We make a pretty nice big happy family.  With 4 kids we often have to divide and conquer.  This weekend, as it’s been the past several weekends, we have two separate events. Our oldest girl has a soccer tournament and our boys have wrestling practice.  I’m the wrestling coach, so the “who does what” isn’t pliable. 

But yeah, my wife for the third Saturday in a row is going to a 6-8 hour soccer tournament with her ex (oldest girls father). Now this didn’t even occur to me as anything the first two weeks, but I think I’m a little concerned now.  They really seem to enjoy these things. And I had initially assumed they wouldn’t be around each other much, but that’s completely incorrect. It’s pretty much a 8 hour catch up session between the two where he buys her food and Starbucks while they bond over their daughter. 

Yeah feeling insecure now..."
510,"Hi theres this guy (ted) who is younger than me. ive known him for several years, his also my brothers bestfriend .one day he confessed that he loved me and has had a crush on me for a while and was working up the courage to tell me. At first i was surprised mainly because his been a bestfriend to me during like 5 years. Ive been single for 6 years and in a depressed state. all my relationships have been horrible and my last bf 6years ago cheated on me twice with the same girl but second time got her pregnant . so we broke apart and moved in back with my parents. Ive been numb by heart ever since like a year and a half ago is when i started to want to actually workmyself out of that depressed state. I had gained like 150 pounds during that period of time so thats when i finally relized i needed to change. During like 6 months in that journey ted confesses to me . yes im working out and trying to stay possitive and healthy but i didnt anticipate someone likeing me after being horrible relationships and being way overweight still. And because i was still numb by heart i said no . ted proceeded to let a couple more months go by and he confessed to me again to which i reject again . (BIG MISTAKE) its been a year and 3 months now and im barley at the stage where i want to open up heart and sexual wise but as i was in process of doing so all i could think of was ted so i called him told him how i felt and we proceeded to talk more about it.

After so long i finally open up and this happens but he is my bestfriend and wanted to hear him out. I asked me why didnt he tell me before i fell in love with him. Ted said he hadnt spoken to her in months and had forgotten. He felt alone and liked the feeling he had when he was with me.

Idk wat to do how to react can someone plz help me"
511,"So reddit I need your help.. my child’s father and I have been through literally hell and back. Countless break ups but yet we always find our way back to each other after 5 years, I’ve put OP’s on him for acting erratic when he’s mad which results in him doing stupid stuff, we didn’t have the healthiest relationship before our daughter was born, his family doesn’t really like me anymore because of the OP’s and mine doesn’t like him because of how he’s acted and treated me. But through all the good, bad and the ugly.. my heart still only wants him. I’m just tired of going through toxic cycles and my daughter doesn’t deserve that.. but I’ve felt from the moment we started talking 5 years ago that he was my soul mate (as cheesy as that sounds.) I just don’t know what to do. Do I ignore my feelings and keep trying to move on? Or do I listen to my heart?"
512,"My boyfriend hates confrontation. When my bf and I had gotten together my parents were really abusive (expecting Christianity and him not being a Christian). His friends blamed me. 

I left home pretty abruptly and my BF and I had taken a break. After being out of my parents home we got back together and any kind of mental illness issue he had after the fact his friends used me as a scapegoat (despite his insistence that I wasn’t and my insistence of therapy) 

After a while my bf got tired of it and basically yelled at all of them to shut up about it. And they did. Most of them are okay with me now. 

Except for the one guy who basically ties the friendship group together. He goes out of his way to make sure I’m never invited to anything, even if I’m just sitting there not involved (like dnd). 

I’m frustrated out of my mind because I’ve been out of my home for about a year and this particular friend has told me he hates me outright. 

What do I do here. I’m not trying to be unreasonable, but I’m tired of not being included. I don’t expect 24/7 (he should be able to spend time with them without me) but it’s bad enough to the point we’re I can’t be near his friends at all."
513,"To put it in context, My (17F) SO (19M) and I are a long distance relationship, and we’re about a month and a half in so we’re relatively new. Recently we got into an argument about each other’s availability (different time zones, three hours apart) and it resulted in us taking a break. I was the person to initiate the argument because lately I felt like they were becoming more distant in the past few days following the argument. I didn’t intend it to become one, neither of us were angry tbh but argument is the best way I can put it. They agreed with my points, but then they suggested to take a break mainly so we could focus more on ourselves than each other. He also told me that he needed time to rethink our relationship, but assured me that once the break was over we would get back together. Honestly I don’t really think we resolved the problems, but just confirmed that we both felt the same. When the break ends, I was thinking of discussing solutions to the problems, but I don’t want to speak up any more arguments/anger towards one another. Should I discuss it with him or not, will it ruin our relationship?"
514,"My boyfriend (m18) and I (f19) have been together for almost three years, and we've been through a lot already. For the first few months, it was fine, but I wasn't exactly serious about him at the time. Years have passed and I've already decided that I do want him, and that I do love him genuinely.

My problem now is that I couldn't stop feeling like I'm...not loved?? Somehow? I don't know why. I've asked him a lot if he was serious about me, if he was ever going to leave me if given the chance. He's told me everything I wanted to hear. It's stupid when I think about it considering it's been three years, but I can't help but feel like there's something missing.

Anytime I can't talk to him, I begin to think about the possibility that maybe he's talking to someone better, or hanging out with someone more fun. I start to think of all the worst things possible and it's actually hurting me. How do I get this to stop? And where is this feeling coming from?"
515,"Me and my gf are long distance (she lives in Texas and i live in Pennsylvania) and she told me through text that she cuts herself. 

She said it doesn't leave scars and she's right (i know what her legs look like so i can confirm that) but she also said that ""it stops the shuddering, stuttering and crying "" and ""it's the only thing im good at"" and i tried to tell her that she doesn't need to do that to feel happy, but she just brushed it off.

She is severely depressed, and i'm scared for her. I don't know what do. I'm gonna try to comfort her when i can, but i feel like i can do more...but I'm not sure what i CAN do.

Can y'all help me with this? I really need it."
516,"So my ex and I broke up  for the seconded time about two weeks ago and we broke up casue something in her heart didn't feel good about our relationship and how I treat her to good and she still needs to get over problems and all that stuff, then like a few days after we broke up she started ""talking"" to this guy (by the way the are not dating and they still aren't). The reason I know this is because me and my ex and I sit at the same table at lunch with the same friends, and she would talk about him with the girls at the table and I think they have been making out and he probley gave her a hickey, also she would kinda mess with me that she met someone but like jokingly, we always joke around like bullying each other even when we were not dating. Anyways she had some problems with him because he is kinda talking to this other girl and let her wear his hoodies, they hug and she is his screen saver, and I was trying to cheer her up by telling her that the other girl is just a friend to him, she didn't believe that, but I think they made up casue they look happy talking to each other, but today I told her I still love her and she said she still loves me, and idk if she is lying or just keeping me on the sidelines just in case the guy she is talking to doesn't work out. Its just like I tried so hard to get over her and I cant and I want her and I love her.She is also way out of my league and the guy she is talking to is in her league I guess, like Im bralley taller than her and im like the third most smallest guy in the High School including the fucken freshmen. I just don't know what to do."
517,"I want to be heard, and I need some support. Please help. I know this will be long, but I would appreciate if anyone could read this. There is obviously so much more to this, but I can't quite touch on everything in a single post. 

We have been dating for about a year, living together for five months. She has a lot of trauma in her past and we both have had our share of bad relationships. She is quite a bit younger than me and very pretty. We met through a mutual friend. 

This girl is really great when she's happy. We never fight about money, household chores, etc. However, when she gets the slightest bit uncomfortable or irritated, she blows up on me and launches an all-out verbal and mental assault. I felt like I have been walking on egg shells for a very long time. She seldom apologizes for the things she says to me. While angry, she has told me she would leave me for another man, criticized me for being 30 years old and not settled down, told me I would never find another girl as good looking as her, etc. Oftentimes, while angry about something, she will take down pictures of us from her Instagram and add pictures of herself. At one point, I went to dump her, she begged for me back, told me she would work on herself, etc. But things pretty much got worse in the long run. I acknowledged that I had some faults of my own and apologized for them. I'm not a perfect person, but I would never personally attack her. 

I have said some things in the past, very early on when we first started dating, which continue to upset her to this day. My girlfriend did not come off as the insecure type when I first met her. A year ago I was telling her a story about an older lady at our workplace (this lady works for a different business there and the story did not involve me). I referred to this lady as being ""subjectively good looking"" as in, well, she looks good for her age. Not like ""I think she's hot"" or ""I want her,"" but just subtly acknowledging that she isn't ugly and is probably used to male attention. It was relevant to the story. It was a passing comment. This was nearly 12 months ago and I in no way have communicated with this lady since that time aside an occasional distant wave as I'm passing by at the workplace. This often crops up in my girlfriend's fights with me. I have apologized incessantly for it, and I honestly feel terrible that I made my girlfriend feel insecure in any way. I assured her I've had nothing and want nothing to do with this lady or anybody in my workplace, and that my girlfriend is one of two women in my life (the other being my mom, of course). I've had my share of flings and relationships. She knows this. But I am truly devoted to my partner, and have seeked a stable, respectful relationship my entire life. 

Within the last few months, she started aggressively putting her hands on me during arguments. At first, I would sternly tell her ""Do NOT put your hands on me right now"" and she would stop. However, it progressed to her physically blocking my way when I wanted to step outside, and then eventually shoving me and punching me in the arms, chest and back. Twice she has pulled a knife from the knife block and went to the bathroom, claiming she doesn't want to live anymore. She locked the door once, and I had to tell her that if she didn't open it, I would have to call for help. On my birthday, because I didn't react excited enough for the cake she got for me (I was physically ill that day, yet showed excitement and thanks for it because it was really nice), she got so angry she started getting up in my face and hitting me again. I told her I was going to stay in a hotel for the night. I finally managed to step outside. Not wanting to pay $158 for 10 hours at a hotel and not wanting to wake the neighbors with needless fighting, I slept in the backseat of my car. She never apologized for it. It's like it never happened. 

I realize that I am sometimes somewhat reluctant to come home, especially on days when she is randomly being nasty to me. I have no control over it. I act happy to see her, even when she won't take her eyes off her phone when I walk through the door. I work late nights and have grown tired of having to defend myself over something that happened many months ago which I have already apologized for. I've heard her out. I have stated my position, realized my faults and sincerely apologized. But it always comes back. I get nervous while watching TV with her because I'm afraid something will come up that triggers her. She has told me in the past ""men are stupid and easily taken advantage of"" and any story involving a man abusing a woman brings out anger towards me and this senseless misandry, something I have told her I don't approve of. 

Don't get me wrong... When she's content, she's great. We do a lot together and have some great memories. However she is benefitting greatly from this relationship. I have made sacrifices to better both of our lives. I left (what I now consider to be) an ideal living situation so we could get started together, which in turn pulled her out of a very bad living situation at her mom's house. She pushed *hard* for it. I sold my cherished car to buy a more practical vehicle which she could also drive (she can't drive a stick). I added her to my cell phone plan and made the down payment on a lease and new contract so she could have a better phone with better service. She doesn't have a license right now due to a very unfortunate car accident, so I take her to and from work, appointments, to get her nails done, out to shop, etc. I really, truly care about this girl. I never held any of this against her. I did it for us, because I love her. I wanted to be a team. For me, it just became a way of life. None of it mattered to me. 

And I'm worried for her. Her family is in complete shambles. The house is deplorable. She has intense waves of depression, anxiety and anger. She said she would work on her behavior towards me, but it has only gotten worse, and I blame myself for not putting my foot down and therefore allowing it to be normalized.

Most recently, we were enjoying ourselves together, playing a card game and having some drinks. She was clearly getting drunk. Things were great that night and for days prior. Once again, her end of the conversation slowly turned towards how men are stupid, women are smart for taking advantage of them, etc. I put great effort into steering it into a friendly direction and did not display any disapproval or offense. She did not relent. She started talking about how no girl looks as good as her. Then she brought up that one lady I talked about almost a year ago. I stood up and said I don't feel good about this, or comfortable about this conversation. Her agitation peaked, and I told her I am tired of apologizing for the same thing over and over, and it doesn't make sense anymore. She told me ""it's you saying things like that which make me want to go fuck somebody else."" I went to leave and she once again blocked my way. She hit me a few times as I made my way outside. My neighbor was outside smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer. I joined him for about 20 minutes as I thought it out.

When I entered, she was flipping through Instagram on her phone on the couch and didn't turn to me. I decided to avoid the potential shit storm, opting to go to my computer and play a game, hoping she would cool down. Shortly after I started, she confronted me from the doorway and I took my headset off. What I can remember is her saying ""if you put that headset back on, I'm breaking up with you."" I put the headset back on. She rushed over, ripped the headset off my head, and pushed me back away from the computer. She started punching my arms and body with all of her might. I repeatedly told her to stop. She grabbed me by the neck, choking me as she yelled into my ear. I got away and walked outside again. This process repeated, with me coming back in a while later, getting on my computer and her beating me. This time, I went to walk to the balcony to smoke a cigarette, and she pulled me down to the ground and beat me. I completely broke down and kept saying ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you."" Sobbing like a baby. It was pathetic. She told me to stop crying as she got up and stomped around me. I walked outside and she chased me down the stairs and outside. I pulled out my phone and called the local police department. I told them my girlfriend and I were fighting and I needed help. I just didn't want to sleep in my car again. I wanted them to take her home and separate us. When they arrived, the officer shined a flashlight at my face and remarked on the nail marks on my neck, as well as a gouge on my bicep. At that point, they had to take her in. I filled out a statement and went back inside while she was taken away. She had no marks on her (I didn't hit her). I told the officer to tell her I love her. I was completely shocked and restless. Scared. 

She called me from jail, crying. She told me she was scared because she was in a cell, near weird people, and in a jumpsuit. I told her I know, I have been there (a major non-DUI traffic offense when I was younger), and I'm sorry but she can't put her hands on me, and it wasn't what I wanted. All she had to say was ""they were just body shots."" I attended her first hearing, told the judge that alcohol was a major contributing factor, and it could have been resolved, I wanted her to come home, etc. So the judge released her without bail. I intend to attend a domestic abuse course and fill out a statement in an effort to dismiss her case because I do not want a battery charge on her record, even though I had visible bruising on my arms, chest and neck. I feel like she doesn't deserve a charge like that on her record. 

But there is no remorse. She still believes it was justified... Not that she directly said so, but she made no point of apologizing to me for putting her hands on me. She did, however, go out of her way to apologize for being so terrible to me in general over the course of our relationship. At this point, I feel like it's too little, too late. I am currently visiting family out of town (she was supposed to come with, but is not allowed to leave now due to her charge) and extended my stay a few days. My family has been worried sick about me. I firmly intend to break up with her when I return home.

We had plans. I saw a future with her. But now I realize she is not good for me or for herself in this relationship. I have grown tired. I love this girl and I want to be with her, but I have given her enough chances. With each chance I gave her, she lost more respect for me. She is waiting for me to come home so we can go do a few other things we planned for vacation, but my heart is broken knowing that I have to break it off with her. She will be going back to a disgusting house without a car or a license. I am not looking forward to this conversation tomorrow. How do I get over the guilt? She will have spent her entire vacation waiting for me to come home, only for me to come home and break it off with her. I feel like I betrayed her by calling the police, but it was getting so out of hand. I didn't want this. I feel like I want to leave the door open for her. Should I?

TL;DR. Girlfriend started hitting me, got out of control one night and she ended up in jail. How do I get past the guilt of cutting her off after making up and sending her into a bad situation?"
518,"My [22M] girl friend [22F] brokeup with me due to trust issues. We had been in relationship since 5years. She brokeup with me one month back. I didn't talk to her since breakup, to maintain no contact. When i see her, i can see love in her eyes. She went to depression due to her studies,  family issues etc.,
I want to make her happy. I cannot see her depression.  Is there any chance to get back her? How can I make her happy ? How can I prove myself that Im changed?
Im non Englishman,  sorry if there are any mistakes."
519,"Sorry in advance for the scatterbrained nature of this post but I’m still pretty much fuming over what happened last night and I feel like I just need to rant to get it off my chest.

“Barry” and I met on World of Warcraft 3 years ago.  We met, knew we were perfect for each other, moved in together (I moved to Texas from Canada to be with him!) and finally got married last year.  I gave birth to our daughter back in June, and she’s pretty much the world to us.  However, here in the past few months, I’ve noticed that Barry has been growing very distant from me.  Whenever I confront him about it, he blames it all on my choice to play WoW Classic every single night.  The thing is, I made it VERY clear to Barry how important this was to me.  I told him that this was the thing I’ve been looking forward to most in my life and that I am going to take it very seriously when it came out.  He understood and said that he would obviously enjoy playing with me.

Fast forward to last night.  It’s raid night; if you are not familiar, raiding is the “endgame” content for World of Warcraft.  A group of 40 players go into a dungeon and kill bosses for loot for several hours.  Most groups do this on Tuesday night because that’s the day that all the dungeons reset and the bosses become killable again.  Barry KNOWS that Tuesday night is the most important night of the week for me, as he has been a WoW veteran for even longer than I have.  Yet he had the temerity to criticize me and tell me that he thinks I should be more focused on our child than “my loot”.  I pretty much hit the roof in anger.  How dare he?  A million thoughts went through my mind in an instant and there was so much I wanted to say but I was so flustered that nothing could come out of my mouth.  After EVERYTHING I do, after carrying that child in my womb for 9 months, after 5 grueling hours of labor, he has the nerve to suggest that I am not the best mother I could be?

I know I am not in the most stable mindset right now, especially because we didn’t even kill Ragnaros last night and I’m still very upset about that, but I really need assurance from people in this sub that I’m not crazy for being angry at my husband over this.  To imply that I love WoW more than my family is enough to make me want to just leave.  I have never felt so disrespected.  Again, he knew what he was getting when he married me.  I seriously can’t have one single night where I get to do something I enjoy?  What do I do?

TL;DR - my husband accused me of loving WoW more than our family. I’m livid and don’t know what to do.

Also, to anyone who thinks this is a troll: kindly fuck off.  Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*EDIT\*\*

Just to paint a more clear picture (because I was angry and ranting and not really doing a good job of explaining our situation at first): I am a stay at home mom.  Barry works full time, but works from home quite frequently.  Barry also plays WoW; he leveled my character for me after he leveled his.  He plays far more than I do, save for the last few weeks when he's been very busy with work.  I do *not* criticize him for his game time because I understand that he deserves ""me time"" as well.  We do not play together in the same guild, as he feels like the people he plays with are a little too toxic for me and doesn't want me around them.  I spend far more time looking after the child than he does, and seems to make a very big deal about it every time I ask him to watch her when I want a little relaxation time.  Hope that paints a better picture of the situation."
520,"I (17M) used to see this girl (17F) about a year ago and we hung out around 6 times. Things ended because she asked me if I had feelings and I said no and she got really angry/lashed out and said I used her.

We never had sex, but she wanted to and after she got mad at me she said “I still want to have sex though” I declined. Anyhow for the past year she’s still wanted to have sex with me and has been trying to get me to have sex with her. She’s a virgin, so she’s never had sex and she’s pretty so I feel like she could easily have sex with any other guy. When I asked her about it she said that every other guy is gross. Why is she so persistent in having sex with me? Like if she is just really horny, then she could easily get sex elsewhere? Plus it’s been a year."
521,"TL;DR i have feelings for one brother (A) but the other brother likes me (B). even though i like A, i am unsure if it’s worth risking the wrath of B and our family friendship and i don’t know what to do. 

basically my family and i (21F) are good friends with a family with four sons. i developed feelings for the youngest son (25m, we’ll call him steven) pretty instantaneously when i met him a few years ago. i know there was an instant connection and mutual attraction there, but i have held off on pursuing him for two reasons: 1) i know he’s a good person, but i think he’s still stuck in this playboy/cocky phase and i think he needs to mature more (and honestly so do i) and 2) a little over a year ago, his brother (26M, we’ll call him evan) admitted to me that he likes me and wants to pursue a relationship with me, and while i told him i was flattered, i also told him that i don’t see anything romantic between us and that we’re better off as friends. evan thanked me for being honest with him and told me that this would in no way affect our friendship. 

recently we were all together at an event and me &amp; steven were hanging out and flirting a decent amount. evan, who i think was a little tipsy, was very upset and proceeded to tell me how he hates me cause i’m “playing the game.” he then went up to two of my other friends and said that if steven tries anything with me, he’s going to “break his legs.” 

it’s been over a year since evan told me he liked me, and i try not to flirt with steven directly in front of evan because i would never want to hurt him, but at the same time i can’t help who i’m attracted to. i’m sorry that it’s his brother, but i’ve had feelings for steven before i even knew evan liked me. but i’m also scared that me liking steven could drive a wedge between him &amp; evan and i don’t want to cause a strain in their relationship, or ruin the friendship we have between our families. i truly like steven and see potential with him down the road, but is it worth the risks? what should i do? any and all advice is appreciated!"
522,"have a sibling who's been living with my parents for quite some time.
 she's living there with her daughter and her on and off again boyfriend . she is not working, smokes pot and God knows what else . Recently she has been institutionalized yet released back 3 times in the past 4 years. 

Most  recently she  robbed my father in the home a for  money (300+)  she use a knife to push him out of the home and wouldn't let her or officers in the home.
 he is going to have an order of protection. 

 she uses fear and physical intimidation  to make sure my mom is on her good side or ""else"".

I think my parents are really caring and wondering if there's anything I can do to make sure that she doesn't keep doing this ..  
would it be considered elder abuse ?

Another question I have is my sisters  paranoia  And schizophrenia is making her child believe what her mom says and  That she IS being followed and she is scared to go to school because of it... mind you she's only into kindergarden. Her child missed a month of classes already. 

I'm just an aunt to the daughter and a sister to this crazed person.  What legal action can I do for my parents? 

Being on the show Intervention  is not an option.  Haha.."
523,"TL:DR: I want to leave my marriage but now my support system seems to be having a change of heart. 


I’m a 30F who has been in a marriage for 3 1/2 years and with my spouse (38M) for 6 years. The beginning of our marriage was tough, while dating I felt alone and even up to when we entered into marriage, I felt alone. After countless tears and finding out my husband was cheating on me, I ultimately gave into a guy and engaged in an affair. It started and ending horribly. My husband found out and was devastated, within that year of recovery, all of my husbands other dirt came out and now here I am feeling forced to make it work because we have 3 children. (2 together)... My husband makes poor decisions and has been guilty of lying about things for my attention (he said he had to have brain surgery because he’s epileptic).. we got denied for a house loan and while trying to gather life to try again.. he purchased a new truck without discussing it fully with me (really selfish)... 

I’m becoming frustrated because these are things that bother me and I struggle getting passed. I’ve grown distant from him and I don’t feel connected. I really just want to be out of this marriage. If we were dating, I would have ended it by now. I only feel like I’m in it because I don’t want to hurt his feelings and the children. Everyone is like “the grass isn’t greener” and blah blah blah but am I supposed to just stay in something I feel like I’m not happy in? 

I feel like I’ll only be married because everyone else wants me to stay married.  Why is it like that? Why do I feel like I’m giving my reasons why and everyone keeps inflicting all their reasons why I can stay?! Like I haven’t exhausted my options? Like I’m not the person dealing with this shit. 

Who wants to always question what their spouse says?! &amp;&amp;&amp; why tf does everything think I’ll just move on to a new guy. I’m annoyed AF. I feel like everyone in your corner when your fussing about it but now that I’m like “okay eff this” it’s “you’re not ready, what about the kids? You know you’re likely setting yourself up to be single forever”..

Like what.the.fuck? Are you not the same people who was like “do it yourself girl, roll out”! 

I’m starting to feel alone and afraid. It’s been 2 1/2 years of wanting out and now that I’m closer to it, the fear of everyone keeps piling on. Should I just stay quiet and just move on my own and then say “hey I did it!” When it’s done?  

I’m over this crap. I’m starting to really feel numb."
524,"I'm just at a loss, I don't know what to do. If I don't tell him to do something, he doesn't take initiative and it's very annoying.

Examples are taking out the trash, picking up after himself, changing our sons diaper or putting him to bed.
It's very frustrating cause I feel like a mother to him instead of a partner/girlfriend.

We've been together for 6 years and lived with each other for 4.5 years. It's always been like this. What do I do to fix it because I tried talking to him a little bit about it before.

I guess a little more insight: I'm a SAHM and he works full time. When he comes home he plays his video games the rest of the night. We are both gamers, I don't mind him playing but I shouldn't have to tell him to do things, especially for our son."
525,"sorry in advance for the long post but i would really appreciate some advice. i was dating him long distance for 3 months, everything was going great until one day he ghosted me for a day, and a week later he ghosted me again, this time for 4 days. After that episode i asked him if he wanted to be with me, and he said hes that a bad texter but he cares for me so long story short ""he doesnt know"" then changed his mind later on and said he wants to be with me and that he'll try. I asked him if hes sure and he said ""idk"" again and told me he'll message me later. ofc he didnt and after 3 days of not hearing from him i decided to tell him i cant do this anymore and that we should breakup. Homeboy did not reply to my breakup text and its been a week....... all i want is closure bc i dont even know why he wanted to breakup in the first place. Can anyone give me their 2 cents on this plz."
526,"Now before you judge me, yeah I know it sounds kinda dumb but let me give some back ground.

I’m a 18 year old girl who just started my freshman year in college, my ex bf also started his freshman year in college. My best friend is 20 and she goes to a beauty school.

I know for a fact my best friend would never hit on my ex boyfriend because 1) she has a very hot bf, and 2) she’s not that type of person. Even so she always continued to show an odd interest in my ex bf when we were dating. Face timing him, always sending him selfies through Snapchat trying to fish for compliments (for example she would send pictures of her face captioning it “why am I so ugly” n shit like that) 

Or sometimes I feel like she would always try to rub in my face how close she was to him, telling me how she calls him nicknames, how his mom thinks she’s pretty, and how he’s her “best friend”

And see I wouldn’t have a problem with this if they were friends before we dated 

But she never showed any interest in him until I told her I was interested in him. She didn’t even know who he was until I started to talk to him 

But besides that here is where things get worse. So me and my bf break up and I was okay with it. I realized I was being a crappy gf and he realized that he didn’t have enough time because of school and whatever 

We only dated for a month so it was a big deal or anything. But I was excited to still be friends with him n stuff. But since we were fighting so much it stressed me out to the point that I got a cold sore 

I only gotten a cold sore a couple times in my life (I only get them when I’m super stressed) and I didn’t realize that they were technically herpes. I told my ex and he blocked me on everything. Told his parents I had an std and insulted me saying I was dirty and that I betrayed him (just a heads up cold sores aren’t stds) 

I knew that he wasn’t infected with anything because I haven’t seen him in three weeks and I got the cold sore two days ago. No way he got anything. And I didn’t tel him about my cold sores cause I didn’t get them that often and didn’t realize they were a big deal

But the next day he told all his friend that I had stds and told a bunch of guys that I had stds so he could “warn” them about me. Then proceeded to text my best friend telling her I was trashy, dirty, etc.

And even after a week of all that happening she still continues to have a streak with him.

But yeah that’s the back ground on what happened and I guess my main question is.... do I have the right to be mad she still has a streak with him??? And I’m pretty sure she still text him and is all buddy buddy with him.... and how should I bring this up to her????"
527,"I've been dating this girl for over a month. At the beginning we hit it off fairly well sharing a lot of things in common, but I wont go to into detail there. Now before we started to date, she told me she has serious depression along with other issues. This girl has SERIOUS issues, her dad is a piece of shit, (something we had in common) and her friend group raises some serious questions, but I've let her be with that. 

Now Naively, I thought dating a girl with depressions wouldn't be so bad. My entire household has depression so I was used being around those people because they would talk to me about it. She wont, ever. She tells me that she feels bad trying to dump things on people and make them her personal therapist. I thought in time she would open up to me, then came last Thursday.

We we're driving home from the movies, and then she got a text from one of her ex's. Her ex (19F) claimed that she jumped from her previous boyfriend (18M) to me and is just doing it to ""use us"" for attention. Her previous boyfriend, was just a POS to be quite frank and i'm quite glad she got away from him. She showed me this text and I tried to explain to her that she wasn't using me, but I was being an idiot and not explaining it right. I got out of the car and then bam, things went bad.

She started not wanting to hang out with me, always being ""busy"" or tired and instead started to hang out with her friends. I felt like that text was the issue and I tried to talk about it, but she denied it being an issue. However, I just can't get it out of my head that something is wrong even if she says there isn't. 

I'm starting to get angry, not just at her but myself. I know people with depression push themselves away, but I still can't help but get sad and anxious over it. I had convinced myself it was something that I had done, but all of my friends deny it. What can I do to help her? I trying asking previously, but all I got from her was ""You cant"", which was more heartbreaking then anything. What can I do?

TL:DR: My Girlfriend with depression got a text from her ex saying she was using me for attention, hasn't been the same for a week."
528,I have a close guy friend of mine who is 14 years older than me and I am 18 and I've been feeling attracted to them and it seems it's mutual as our conversations have gotten more flirty. I've talked to a couple people in my life and everyone is telling me to be really careful especially since my ex and I broke up a month or so ago. I want to make sure this attraction is real but I don't know what kind of red flags to look for and no one in my personal life is helping. What are some things I should watch out for or things to think about?
529,"I work 2nd shift. She works part time 1st shift. The way it is now, during the work week, we get an 1 to 1.5 hours together in the morning, 45 min together before I leave for work, and once or twice a week she will stay up for me at night to get another hour.


Next week she will go to work earlier so no morning time  and she cant stay up. Might still get the 45 min. How do we deal with not seeing each other during the work week?

Tl;dr How do we cope with this?"
530,"Hi Reddit, I’m a female in college, and I live in a dorm on a college campus with a roommate my same age (about 20). She (let’s call her Jane) is an extreme night owl, while I tend to need more sleep, and head to bed earlier (around 10:30 to 11 pm). Roommate also is very unaware of things, like trash, bo, tidiness etc.

We are both engineering majors, so we have difficult classes, and thus, need full brain power and time to study. The issue is when and how she studies. We have fairly similar schedules, neither of us have jobs, and I am in a few clubs. She chooses to play video games, watch tv etc at normal study time (from like 2 til 6) or she will nap all day. She doesn’t start studying until 6 or 7 causing her to stay up late with a light on til midnight to 2 am. 

Our dorm is a few feet away from a study lounge, which other students use, where she could study if she would like to continue this late night schedule. However, like I mentioned earlier, she is very unaware of things. After I casually mentioned/ asked for lights off earlier, with no changes, I sat down with her and politely, but directly, told her that it isn’t healthy for me to not get enough sleep. I have 8 am classes, and if I can’t sleep til 1 am, I’m not mentally awake enough for the class. I have not mentioned the bo and trash issues and so on. I feel as tho that’s a secondary issue compared to the sleep issue.

I understand that it’s a shared space, but I’m getting sick, my grades are slipping, and I’m tired all the time. My schedule doesn’t allow me to nap all day, and I’m not a night owl. 


How do I tell her or talk to her in a way that she knows that she can’t keep the lights on so late?


Info:
When we had our sit down, she did say she would turn lights off at 11. She did this for about 2 days, and went back to her old habits. 

She did mention using the study lounge; she has yet to.

I have tried to tell her to turn the light (desk lamp, but it’s very bright) off, but she is watching tv or playing music and can’t hear me. Plus, I don’t want to have to manually climb up and down my loft bed every night just to poke her to sleep. Ive done this before, and it may take her 10 to 1+ hours to turn off lights. Depends if she remembers that I asked. I shouldn’t and don’t want to nag her every 5 min for sleep.

She is also very loud. Like, she slams the door, stomps around, just general sounds she makes are loud. I’m very quiet (or i try my best) when she sleeps all day or something, but she doesn’t seem to care about my sleep needs.

I’ve lived with a roommate before. She was a night owl. When I started my bedtime routine (grab my toothbrush etc) she’d grab her stuff and go study elsewhere. I never heard or saw her until I woke up the next morning.

tl;dr- roommate doesn’t respect my sleep needs, causing me to get sick and not do as well in college. Direct approach didn’t work."
531,"My friend, who has always seemed at least slightly flirty with me, recently broke up with her boyfriend. She also knows that I am I having doubts about my girlfriend and our future and that a breakup may be eminent. 

We originally met because I approached her in a class, but when i asked her out during that time period she said we should just be friends “FOR NOW” because she had a bf. This was a year ago. 

She has started texting me random stuff, replying to my Instagram and Snapchat stories with random replies. 

Does she just feel more comfortable to talk to guy friends now that her bf is gone? Or is she eyeing me for a rebound or relationship?

Should I make a move at this upcoming party and leave a good but unexciting relationship?"
532,"Been buds with Roger for as long as I can remember. Never knew his little bro much since they had two different moms. Roger's gf (now wife) had a baby 2 years ago. They were really struggling financially and that's how Dylan (little brother got involved). He moved in with them for cheapish rent and babysits their kid for free during the day and works mostly in the afternoon/evening. 

I see Roger fairly frequently plus he started bringing Dylan to poker nights and whatnot. So I've gotten to know him. Dylan's definitely gay. He's mentioned guys before. He's kinda feminine but not obnoxiously. He can still fit in with the guys without putting them off too much. 

Anyways I don't really know how to explain how I feel about him. Fascinated maybe? He's different. I've always been attracted to alternative looking women. Love women with short hair/tattoos/piercings. 

Dylan has tattoos which I like. No piercings. Normal dude hair. He's kinda androgynous looking. I like that a lot. Honestly, he kind of reminds me of art. Like I could just look for a long time and it makes me think. It's hard to explain. I hope that makes sense.

He's also real chatty. I'm an awkward dude at the best of times so he keeps the small talk going. He's been flirty a few times, maybe testing the waters? I don't know. I wasn't flirty back. Couldn't if I tried.

Anyways we all went out a few weeks ago for drinks and he asked for my number when I said I liked bowling. He wanted to set something up. So he's been texting me on and off, mostly not about bowling. If he were a girl if say he's into me but I don't know, this is all new territory.

His most recent text was asking if I was free Saturday and if I'd be interested in getting dinner too. Is this a date? I'd feel stupid if I asked if it was a date and he said no and was weirded out or whatever. Then again if Roger or one of the other guys suggested something like this I wouldn't think date. So wtf.

Let's be real. I'm a curious guy but at the same time not certain. Don't care what people would think besides Roger really. I don't think he'd approve plus if shit hit the fan it could really mess with our friendship and make things awkward.

Plus Dylan is a cool dude and I don't want to treat him like an experiment or whatever. Especially if I end up not into it.

So ya, don't really know where that leaves me. Kinda at the point in my life where I get the fuzzies when I see Dylan all cute like with Roger's kid, but at the same time women are hot and I can stick to that team if need be. But I've got this what if in my head I can't shake off. 

What's the best thing to do in your opinion? I'm really on the fence."
533,"I’ve posted here before about situations that I’ve gone through so if you want a broader perspective you can always read those.

So me and my ex broke up 4 months ago and for me at least it was terrible and for the 2 months after I found myself not doing to great mentally and was trying anything I could to salvage the relationship. After i came to terms with it I briefly talked to another female that made me forget about my ex and gave me a sense of companionship and affection that I desired. That ended just as quickly as it started but I was still in a much better place then when me and my ex broke up. 

Recently, I’ve found myself comparing my relationship ventures to my exes and it makes me sad, angry, and just a whole flurry of emotions. Me and her didn’t end off well as she said hurtful things, threatened me, and cheated on me and only told me after she broke up with me to “make me hate her”. She told me recently that she would really like to be friends with me as I was her best friend for the two years we were together but she shows no effort to converse with me and only talks to me while she’s at work and when she’s off she ghosts me.  I don’t want to be her friend as I feel it will only be one sided and her interests are vastly different from mine as when she broke up with me she started partying and drinking and sleeping with random people, which is fine but isn’t my cup of tea.

Periodically we’ll speak but it’s only for her to vent to me what she has going on in her life and I can’t express how I feel or what I have going on as she ghosts me or pulls the “I’m busy” card. She’s not doing to great as I guess her home life isn’t the best, was sexually assaulted, has to take care of her sisters kids, been dropped by some guy she thought she was going to be with and had a pregnancy scare, as well as almost doing coke and almost started stripping all in the span of the last 4 months. 

Immediately after she broke up with me she started talking to a guy and told me she wanted me to wait around Incase things didn’t work out. She shortly after started staying with him which lasted shortly, then had two one night stands, started talking to another guy for two months and staying with him until he dropped her, and as of now she’s talking to another guy which I can only assume she fancies as she’s made it “Instagram official”.  Me, I’ve only talked to one other girl somewhat seriously and the furthest it went was us meeting up and hanging out. I find myself thinking, “why does she have all these people fawn over her and get into relationships easily after the terrible things shes did and said to me, as here I am just having each day bleed into the next?” I go out with my friends and do stuff I’ll go to bars with the intent to enjoy time with my friends but to also maybe meet someone. I met one girl last week who asked for my Snapchat and only exchanged two messages with me the next day before leaving me on read. 

I’m aware that this is extremely unhealthy and I don’t want to feel bitter or angry but I don’t know what to do. Ive been speaking to a therapist every two weeks for the last 3 months as the break up made me spiral and while I’m nowhere near unstable or emotional  as where I was and don’t want to be with her let alone speak to her I find myself comparing my ventures to hers. I don’t want to even think about her anymore as she said and did things to me that I never thought I’d hear or have to go through. I just constantly wonder why she gets to easily move on and get all these people and affection after what she did and here I am. I don’t want to think like that as I don’t want to wish despair on anyone and I don’t want to compare the success she’s had to the failure that I’ve been experiencing. 

So what I’m asking is how can I stop this unhealthy thinking of comparing my relationship pursuit to hers and if she reaches out again should I just ignore her or try to be friends like she supposedly wants? 

Tl;dr find myself comparing my failed relationship pursuits to my exes which has been been vastly more successful then mine. Looking for advice on how to stop this."
534,"So me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) have been going out for about a year an a half now. I usually go on annual trips to Mexico around christmas time to volunteer, like a mission trip from church. My girlfriend isn't Christian but understands my belief and has come to church with me several times in the past. Last year due to my trip we couldn't spend Christmas together. And she was ok with it cause this was a commitment I had made prior to us even dating. Now I'm trying to go again this year and she's started to show her disappointment and frustration this year. Now I try my best to go on these trips annually and consistently because we usually revisit most of the places we went to and for the past 5 years seeing so many kids change and seeing them grow just touches my heart and gives me so much meaning. When I told my girlfriend that I was going to go again this year, she couldn't help but show how sad she was and spoke as if she wasn't number one on my list. Now throughout the whole year I take time off for her so we can do long weekend trips and even weekend trips to other cities but when I want to continue to do something meaningful with my life. She gets sad cause I can't spend Christmas with her. Is she really overreacting or am I at fault for not putting her as more of a priority in my life? Thanks in advance for all the help"
535,"So just so I can give clear context, I’ll start from the the very beginning up to this point.

So my friend that was dating this girl introduced me to her. Her name was Paris. Beautiful name. My friends name was Gabe. So I started to get to know her even more and more and I really liked her. But he was dating her so I respected it and backed off their relationship. But I began to realize, as she came running to me, that their relationship was very bad. They had too many complications. Soon enough they broke up and it was hurtful and both of them. But even though I realized that my chance was open, I didn’t take it. It would have been just too rude of me to do so. So I waited longer and longer, comforted her as much as I could because of the breakup. But soon she got over it. We began having a lot of fun hanging out together. But fast forward recently, I asked one of my friends for help. His name was John. I asked John that I really liked her, but how can I determine if she liked me back. So he told me this and I decided to go with it. What I did just to test her was not give her as much attention. I wanted to see if she would return as much as I gave. But nothing came up. So I gave up on liking her and decided that I wasn’t gonna try anymore. But I keep getting this feeling whenever I think about her, like there is still hope. So I decide to talk to another one of my friends. His name was max. I told him that I liked her. But soon after I said that, he got introduced to her. And I’ve been seeing that he has been making sure he can give more attention than I could. So I asked him why was he doing this? And I found that he began to like her. I was betrayed by my best friend since kinder. Not only was I stressed by that, but I also have my grades to worry about, some of my other recent friends cut me off, and I’m having a very mix of amazing feelings for Paris but I don’t know how to express them. I’ve been very suicidal ever since. I already got started on my death note. My friends have been giving me mental support. I’m having mental breakdowns in class. My friend John has known Paris much longer than me. I asked him to ask her if she liked me. She said no, she only sees me as a friend. At that point I was ready to end it. My friends would always tell me that it wasn’t worth it over one girl, but I’ve never had this feeling before. And she was just absolutely perfect. But now Max is beginning to give up and the feelings he had for Paris. And now Paris is beginning to just barely give me the attention I was looking for. Not directly, but I can see peripherally that she keeps looking at me in class, whenever we hang out in groups, she is beginning to actually talk to me instead of me starting the conversations. As a matter of fact, Im beginning to run out of things to say so I don’t even know how to keep our conversations going without us being quiet for 50% of the time. But I’m just so confused and I’m just about ready to rest from these thoughts. I’ve decided to come here to ask, to those who read all of this and actually want to help, I give you my blessings. I know there are people here who have had it worse. So I just ask for moral support and advice on what should I do to show her I really like her, how to begin the conversations again, how to keep my head up, anything to keep me from just ending everything. I’m not suicidal, I just want to be able to close my eyes and feel alright but only thing I think about is dying. So please, I ask the most from you all. Thank you so very much.

-Mike"
536,"3 years ago I moved to southern California, leaving all my friends and family behind. I found my current girlfriend on Tinder and we have been dating 3 years. I'm not close with anyone else in the area and she is the only friend I have. From the start of dating I have always been unsure if we should be together. I'm unsure about a lot in my life. We both have jobs in a similar field, we both share unusual hobbies, and we hangout with each other a lot. 

The problem is my past girlfriends have all been free-spirited wild types. She is more worried, fragile, and non-confrontational. If she is angry about something I've done she will not talk to me about the problem and instead sulks. I have to almost play a guessing game and figure out what she wants changed. Sometimes it gets to the point where her not trying to speak her mind makes me angry and in return she gets more sulky.

Lately I've been thinking about other girls and have even been dreaming about my past girlfriends. I'm finding myself more and more un-attracted to her even though we have sex on average twice a week. I fear if I break up with her, not only will it destroy her self-worth, but it will make me extremely lonely and depressed which will lead to me drinking again. She does not know how I feel and thinks we are okay.

I know this is a lot, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. This has been on my mind for almost a year now and I'm finally reaching out to others. I need to move out of my current apartment due to rent increase. Is moving in together a good idea? Am I making this out to be too big of an issue?

Also, I don't need any comments about how I should have broken up with her from the start. 

Thanks everyone."
537,"*EDIT******* He just asked me on a date. Really don’t know what the fuck to do. 



Not going to go too much into detail but he does small things at work to flirt with me,
Now he’s added me on facebook and i realize he’s starting to confide in me at work. He told me if he doesn’t end up happier or has a girlfriend by the end of this year he’s going to kill himself. 
Now he messages me late at night, not anything particularly out of the ordinary but just asks me about my home life and past relationship. He gives me free food but forces everyone else to pay for theirs. He and i used to hate eachother before (it seems like) he found out me and my boyfriend were no longer together. I once made a post about how this manger specifically used to call me “tits mcgee” when i first started working there. 
He used to be in love with another one of the servers there, she has a husband and turned him down but still treats him nicely at work, but she told me today that he texted her saying he hated her and that he couldn’t work with her anymore, called her a lot of awful names and then later on apologized and said he was losing his mind. I don’t know what to do in this situation. Any help is welcome and appreciated. I’m not interested in him because he seems really unstable and has admitted to me that he’s a diagnosed psychopath."
538,"This is kinda my first ever post like this so sorry in advance guys, but I'm in college and I've kinda fallen in love with a guy. So a couple of weeks ago I met up with him at a college event and I ended up hanging up with him at the afterparty and turns out his girlfriend broke up with him. I just want to be a supportive guy so I go out with them to go get break up ice cream, just kinda comfort them all that jazz. Smash cut to 1 Am where we've been talking for 4 hours and we're both tired so I'm laying on him, as bros do, and I decide I decided after some tension between us I went for a complete ""this is so completely stupid, fuck it"" swing for the fences scenario, and I kissed him. We kinda ended up kissing for a while after that but we were both tired and we literally closed out the night with ""It's 1 am can we go to bed and discuss whatever this is tomorrow"" I say okay, and then as soon as I got back to my dorm I ran a victory lap because I was fucking untouchable at that moment. The next morning I text him talking about kinda us and where do we go from here. He texts me back and tells me that last night was really nice and that he liked me but he also got dumped two days before we kissed so he's holding off on the whole relationship thing, which I get completely, ending it by saying it's cool if we want to do stuff but some limitations and I understood him completely.

So smash cut to me three weeks later from this whole thing, I've been steadily hanging out with him more and I guess I finally put in writing how I feel about him because an idiot like me fell in love with him, and what I'm wondering is should I send him this message mostly talking about my feelings for him and if he feels the same way I do, clarifying I'm not mad if he doesn't feel the same way and I'm fine with staying where we are now.

TLDR: Dear God help me do I send this message telling this boy how I feel after making out with him because I hope he feels the same way I do?"
539,"So I was texting my friend (we sext eachother but stopped for a while) I said “Random question do you think your parents would allow you to bring friends to your house? Just wondering” and he said “No they wouldn’t allow it. Why?” And I said “nothing just wondering” it wasn’t just nothing I’ve been thinking if his parents would allow me over but sex wasn’t really on my mind. But I have been wanting to fuck him for a while now. But it got interesting. And after I said that he asked “why” again. I told him  “what do you think? Hmmmm?” And he said back “Oh you mean that? Like that that? Like sex?” 
And my dumbass said “I mean noooo not that.” Idk why I denied it. It’s all I’ve been wanting. He wants to fuck me too I know it. We talk about it all lot. Then he said “oh lmao what then?” I said back “why do you want to know so bad? Hmmmm?” And he said “lol can I not know?” There’s a reason to why he’s asking all these whys right? There’s a thought to it. So there’s a reason why he’s asking. It was just a question now he all up in asking why. (Not that I have a problem with it) 
And I told him a hint. It’s one word and it involves physical-ness. And he said lmao one word? Then that’s when I think he went to bed. 
Idk what just happened but I said “what made you think sex? Maybe..that’s what it is..,is that what you want?” He said back “Yea idk lol” what was he responding to with the yea? And the idk? I’m guessing the Yea was to the is that’s jay you want and the idk was when I asked him what made him think sex? He probably thought that cuz he knows I want to fuck him. 

Don’t ask for my age and stuff just answer my question please. Thank you."
540,"I’m working away from my partner atm and the other night we had all been out for drinks and then about 15 mins after we had gotten back to where we are staying a guy I’m working with came knocking on my apartment door. I was like what are you doing? And he was like I’m not tired and everyone else is boring, let me come talk to you. I shouldn’t have let him in but I did. So we sat in the kitchen talking and had another drink. I knew right then that this was a really bad idea and I shouldn’t have let him in.  After we’d finished our drink I said to him, ok I’m tired now you need to go sorry, and he was like ‘no don’t you be boring too’ I was like sorry I’m tired, so he was like ok...

So we were walking to the door. And he turned around and kissed me. Both of us were kinda tipsy so I kissed back, then realized what I was doing and was like no stop, he was just like ‘uh ok, I’m going’ 

And he left. 

I feel guilty even though I didn’t initiate it, is this something I should just keep to myself or what?"
541,"Over the summer I lived in the same city as one of my best friend’s roommates. We didn’t have any other friends around so we hung out a couple times. It was always pretty casual, except for one or two nights at the club where we danced with each other and it felt a little steamy but then we never acknowledged it. 

We’re all back in our college town now and this guy tags along with his roommate (my friend) occasionally to hang out with our friend group. He hasn’t made a move on me since the summer and doesn’t initiate plans. 

This makes me inclined to feel he’s not interested, but also he’s a bit shy and doesn’t seem to have extreme ease with the ladies by any means so maybe there’s a chance he’s also holding back? I consider myself pretty shy and have never really made a move on a guy before without knowing whether he had feelings or not, so I’m a bit scared to put myself out there. 

I thought about telling my friend about my feelings for his roommate, but we don’t typically share about our love lives and I don’t want him to feel awkward. What do I do!? I’m not really looking for anything serious I just have a crush and would like to get to know him more or maybe just have some sort of friends with benefits situation if he’s down.

Should I just be honest with him? Do I consult my friend to get a hint first so I don’t embarrass myself? Do I just accept that he hasn’t made an effort and therefore probably doesn’t want me? Any advice is greatly appreciated :)

(Also I didn’t do the throwaway thing bc although I am new to reddit, I plan to use it for more than relationship advice, thanks!!)"
542,"Throw away account Incase anyone we know may be on reddit. I didn’t see the sticky post about throw away names before making this account.

Yes, we’re a young married couple. We have been together for almost 2 years, just married at the beginning of this year. My wife has been through a lot in her life. She has on and off depression, but she is the most beautiful and joyful woman I’ve ever met when she is herself and happy. Before she and I met, she was in a really toxic relationship for almost 5 years since the start of high school. Her ex was controlling, did not let her have any friends, got mad when she talked to other guys, went to places without her, etc. At this time she was already suffering from depression, cutting herself which she has many scars on her arms and thighs still, and even tried to suicide before by overdosing. All of this while being with him. I know right? Why did she not just leave? She lost her virginity to him, trusted him at the beginning and felt like he was the only one she had. She didn’t even know the definition of love or what a boyfriend was supposed to be. He took advantage of her and she was too young to realize what was happening. The thing is, throughout their whole relationship, he always wanted sex, no matter when or where. She tries to say no, but he would get mad at her. He always wanted her to send him nudes and videos of herself or else he would get mad at her. She said told him that he has all the old stuff that he could look at, but he would get mad and say that he wants new ones. Don’t forget, she was young and dumb and depressed. At one point she told him that she felt like a sex you to him, and he got angry at her and started making her feel worse about herself and guilty. He followed her everywhere she went with her friends. He always went out and left her alone/ignored her. But never let her do her own thing.

I knew her previously when we were about middle school age because we met once at the playground. Fast forward a couple years later, I saw her profile online and reached out to say hi. Told her about my life and she felt comfortable enough to tell me about hers. I was shocked by everything and told her to leave immediately, but she couldn’t do that, she was stuck with him at the same school. There was not much I could do at this point because I did not know any of her family members to contact and did not know the full story until we actually got together. After high school, she broke up with him and he threatened her and every guy who tried to approach her. He had the “if I can have you then no one can” mentality and tried to fight and threaten anyone who tried to get close to her. This was where I came in and tried to help her after hearing about the news of her being free and trying to change. We blocked him on all her social media and she got a new number. Before all of that though, he said that she will never have a good life and that life will hit her hard. Ever since she’s gotten away from him, she’s been doing so much better. She’s following her goals and dreams, going to college, etc. One of the things that kept her going was social media. She is an amazing singer and model and has a pretty big fan base on YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. We’ve been living the best life and after a year, I proposed to the woman of my life. We had an amazing wedding and honeymoon and have continued living life, while posting about all of our journeys and happiness. 

We thought that we were finally able to live happily and not have anything to worry about. Until recently, she got a message on one of her social media accounts with a picture and message saying “yes, that’s you, your picture has been leaked, don’t be mad because you have a very nice body”. We couldn’t believe it because it was actually her and it was a photo from two years ago. The picture had a social media filter with the date on it. It was a date from a couple days ago, so we know that the picture was posted or shared somewhere, but we don’t know where and who did it. We immediately blocked this person, and deactivated all of our social media accounts. She feels embarrassed and her depression is coming back. It’s getting extreme and we don’t know what else is out there or where it came from. It is possible that her ex was the one who exposed it, but we have no idea. It’s been a rough couple days already because I can’t work with all of these things going on in my head. She’s not herself anymore, talking about suicide and being gone and how everyone is going to hate her and shame her. Our state has a law on revenge porn, but we have no way to prove it was him and we have no idea what else is out there because we got off of everything right away. We have not filed a police report yet because we don’t know if anything will even be done and because we’re not sure if he was the one who exposed it and if there is anything else out there. I’m trying really hard to be there for her. I tried to be the best boyfriend and husband I could ever since we’ve starting dating and gotten married.

Everything is hitting me hard.. I don’t know what to do and how to deal with this.. I’m angry and sad. I don’t want her to blame herself more because she is already blaming herself and saying things like she’s the reason I’m in this position. Everyday this week at work I’ve been thinking about this and I get so angry I just want to get up and hit something, quit, or leave my job. I’ve been her hero and been the positive one, but deep inside I need reassurance and help myself.. She told me that there’s really bad pictures and videos of her... which I won’t go into details.. and just thinking about those videos and picture being out there for everyone to see.. it makes me angry and feel all type of emotions I don’t know about. The thing that angers me is that we don’t even know what else is out there or if those things are already out there. Her life is basically ruined. Once anything is on the internet, it will never be gone. Her fan base is big and she won’t be able to do YouTube or even go out in public or post anything without feeling ashamed or embarrassed anymore. Will we even have a future? I’m trying my best to comfort her, make sure she doesn’t do anything dumb, but I need comfort too and I have no one else to turn to. She doesn’t any any family members to know because they might spread the word or shame her. I’m lying to myself and her with all of this fake positivity because I know the of the worst that can happen.. why can’t we just live our life without anyone trying to ruin it? What can we do? She told me that when they were together, he had a PornHub account. We don’t know what his account is and if there are videos of her already out there. He has pictures and videos of her from the very beginning, even when they were still minors. Like I said, the thing that bothers me the worst is that there is stuff like that of her out there and that we don’t know ANYTHING. I’m deeply very fucking sad that there are even those things out there and that she even did all of those things. But I grew to accept her when she told me.. I know it’s not her fault, I keep trying to tell her, but I feel like I’m lying about it all. I’m very hurt. I don’t want to blame her, it makes me want to find this guy and do things I shouldn’t do. 

She said that she will never be able to achieve her dream and continue being on social media and YouTube. She said that she doesn’t feel beautiful anymore because her body is out there for everyone to see and she doesn’t feel pure anymore. This hit me so hard.. because I’m sad thinking about it too.. I’m sad that this beautiful amazing woman in my life is out there for everyone to see.. I’m sad that I can’t do anything to help her.. It gotten to the point where I thought about all the things her ex did to her and questioning myself and my self confidence. I feel like I won’t be able to reassure her anymore, make her feel beautiful.. prevent her from hurting herself.. I can’t even explain fully about how she really feels. I’m so angry and sad already trying to write this out. Please anyone help me.. can we get her ex arrested without any evidence or proof that he’s the one doing this? I don’t want to try and search online for anything because I’m afraid of finding videos and pictures of her. I don’t know how I will feel seeing them. Throughout our whole relationship I’ve already lack self confidence about our sex life even though our life has been amazing. Please send anything my way.. I’m just in need of my own reassurance and how I can help comfort and reassure her more.. I don’t want to give up on her.. but I’m already giving up on myself.. lawyers, other woman, men, anyone who knows anything please help me.. if nothing extreme is out yet, can we do anything to prevent it from coming out? Should we go file a police report even though we don’t know if anything else is out there? How can I help her more.. how do I make her feel beautiful.. how can I help myself.. please.."
543,"Last week, me, my girlfriend, and her parents went on vacation to Los Angeles to visit her sister. We arrived on Friday and things started out mostly well. I have a fear of flying and I was noticeably nervous throughout the flight. During take-off, we hit turbulence and I was breathing really heavily and gripping my seat tightly, leading to my girlfriend's dad to lean over to say to me ""Quit spazzing out and ruining the flight."" That pissed me off inside, but I didn't say anything and the rest of the flight was incident-free.

After we arrived, the trip was a lot of fun. I met my girlfriend's sister and her husband for the first time and we did a lot. We ate at fancy restaurants, went to a Kings hockey game, went to Universal Studios, visited tourist attractions, and stuff like that. We flew back home yesterday and on Monday evening, we went to my girlfriend's sister's home for one last dinner together.  After dinner, we were sitting out on their back porch when I remembered that the new Star Wars trailer was debuting during Monday Night Football and I mentioned it to my girlfriend's sister and her husband. My girlfriend's dad butt in and said ""We're not focusing on that tonight."" He said it pretty sternly and my girlfriend's brother-in-law politely said that I can just watch it online later. 

I was looking on my phone for when half time was going to start and I excused myself to go inside to use the bathroom. I turned on their TV and watched MNF to wait for the trailer and right when half-time was about to start, my girlfriend's dad came in and shouted ""What are you doing?!"" I told him that I just needed a few minutes to watch the trailer, but then everyone else comes in and my girlfriend's brother-in-law looked really upset. He yelled at me for using his TV and disobeying him and and I didn't get to see the trailer live. My girlfriend's parents agreed to go back to our hotel early and the following morning, we flew back home. My girlfriend's sister and brother-in-law both ignored me when I bid them goodbye.

My girlfriend's parents lectured me non-stop and they both kept using the word ""ruined our vacation"" which I thought was overreacting on their part. My girlfriend is also upset with me and she said that it's my fault that the vacation ended on such a bad note. She told me that she doesn't want to talk to me for the time being and now I'm worried. How do I go about trying to fix this and make things right?"

My GF and I had a decent ongoing LDR 3.5 months together for 5.5 months with my plan to visit her next month.

She broke up with me suddenly last friday saying that she couldnt trust me in the relationship, and with no trust she didnt think the relationship would work out and that she has been unhappy during the LDR. I am being honest that I have not done anything that would warrant suspicion or any cheating involved. There was an incident a few weeks back where I liked one of my ex's photo of a dog on instagram and she saw it on my feed. She didnt make it a big deal or issue out of it or was upset. I am not sure if this was the catalyst to the breakup, but it may have been something to do with it to which she denies. She has always been the negative type, and her unhappiness comes from if there were problems and i tried to resolve, she would push away and say that I'm forcing her to resolve things immediately. This would lead to her saying that we are incompatible in the ways we problem solve things and that we shouldnt be together. I've always managed to persuade her that it takes time for people to understand each other and how to work around the dynamics, especially in LDR.

Interestingly, the day before the breakup, she was being really intimate and emotional with her words, saying she missed me and she couldnt wait to see me in a few weeks (I booked a trip to visit her) and complimented on my outfit etc. In 24hrs she changed completely and dropped the break up bomb on me and paid me the hotel and flight ticket. She wished me the best in the future and said she will delete our conversations. There was no blocking on social media, but she took the time and effort to unlike one of my facebook pictures she liked a few days earlier.

I havent contacted her for the past 6 days, but im not sure if I should let go as i keep wondering if she has moved on already. If i knew the signs of an impending break up I wouldnt be like this, but with the sudden news and out of no where, I feel defeated and lost. I am still going to the country to tag a long with my mate who's also going for a vacation. Should I ask for a meet up or leave my presence on social media to let her know I'm in her country so that she might reach out to me first?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
546,"So I (M17) have a autistic older brother(19) and when he gets angry, which he does often over many things from something as little as being asked to do a small chore or not getting what he wants the way he wants or even being asked to where cloths that aren’t filthy. Any way when this happens he gets very verbally aggressive saying things like “I’ll do what I fucking want” and other insults like cunt, dickhead e.c.t has even gone through a point where he started telling members of the family to kill them selves, something he got from toxic you tubers. Any way I can usually ignore it but sometimes it’s just too much and I and up saying something back making him even worse and he’ll start breaking shit (hell kick holes through his door, smash glasses e.c.t). I know I shouldn’t and I need to be patient with him but at the same time he’s an adult and he knows what he’s doing but I honestly don’t know how to deal with it other than ignoring him and letting him calm down on his own but it’s getting to a point where she’s becoming so disrespectful to everyone and I need a way to make him under stand he can’t do what he does with out being told to “I’ll do what the fuck I want”"
547,"My(20M) girlfriend(20F) has been letting me know that she has been stressed out with school, and recently she had told that she has been missing her dog more. Her dog was a big part of her life and when he was put down, her support when it comes to stress or anxiety. Went away, I was wondering what I can I do to help with stress? Like I want to be there for her but I just know how to do that."
548,"Hello!

I am now in my early thirties and I have slowly come to the conclusion that some of my firends are just incredibly boring/ not my cup of tea. So let me describe the situation. I have two types of social circles, both of them consisting of people I went to school with. One circle might be reasonably called nerdy in that all of them graduated at the very top of the class. One of them is really intelligent, curious and incredibly erudite when it comes to politics, culture and history. Although he is a painfully slow speaker, what he says is usually very interesting, although we have vastly different views on politics (think of Brexiteer vs Remainer as an example). Problem with him is that he is very busy caring for his two children and his wife. He married early, started out as a really succesful student with hopes for an academic career and then depression hit him hard. It is very hard to get hold of him. My other best friend from the nerdy group went to medical school, married an incredibly superficial wife and has pretty much been swallowed by his job as a physician. That and me living at least 800 Kilometers apart from them for the last 13 years has not made things better. But with these two I at least have hope that once we live in reasonable proximity, we might grow closer again.

My real struggle is with the second circle. I also went to school with them but here I am more of an outsider. One of them has been a very good friend all throughout highschool whereas I had met the nerds only late in school. If it was not for him, I probably would not be invited that much. In fact, it is usually my buddy that gets me invited.

But my long time buddy has become the most boring person I know, the other persons on that circle are infinitely more interesting. The reason why they have some reservations towards me is my thankfully slowly dying habit of being very outspoken, something that has alienated people that later entered this circle and did not go to school with us but now are the majority in this group.

I kid you not, with him you can only talk about football. He knows so little about current affairs, his general knowledge is so lacking that us talking politics is more like me giving a lecture, and I am by no means a specialist. Worse, in this circle, if politics is debated at all, I have to more or less hide my views, dumb down my speech and not mention facts and things that are not headlines on a taloid, otherwise he accuses me of being arrogant and showing off. This all sounds incredibly arrogant but a lot of people in the same circle think the same and we are not some pointy headed freaks. Still, my buddy is a very nice chap and has shown interest in me throughout the years, even in times when I really struggled. On the other hand, his attitude towards cheating in a relationship, the way he talks about some women, his materialistic attitude are things that I despise. He is loyal  and always a good sport and that is what makes him reasonably popular. But I suspect that I use him more and more as my entry to social events where I can meet some people I find vastly more interesting. With few exceptions, this second circle is full of conformists. Don't take me wrong, I do not think of myself as an iconoclast nor am I one, but I thrive on a debate as long as it is respectful. The more controversial the topic the better and I prefer to get to the bottom of things. However, with the majority of these people any view outside their bubble is considered  a grave moral affront. (Think of admitting supporting Trump in the hope that that immigration might be curbed and better controlled and the only response you get that this means you are a white supremacist.) There are others in that group as well but since we are all scattered around the globe, my buddy about whom I complained is my acces card to seeing them.

&amp;#x200B;

Any similar experiences? How did you deal with it? How common is it that some of your old best friends have become boring, stuck in their minucule bubble and rigid in their thinking?"
549,"We're both 22, met on Tinder 2 years ago and have been exclusive since. He's an international student and we are in the process of deciding whether to stay together when he has to leave the country for good in a couple of months (he did not get a job in the US and his student visa is expiring). He casually mentions to me during one of these discussions that he ""slipped up"" two summers ago when he was back home and I was here in the US (we were doing long distance for that summer). He says that he had re-downloaded Tinder and was using it, but only swiped left (""not interested"") on the girls and eventually deleted it because he felt bad. I obviously freaked out about this -- he immediately defended himself, saying that he ""was just seeing who was on it"" and that he had been feeling very distant from me at the time because of the distance. He said that he knows now it was a mistake and just wanted to be honest and tell me about it, and that I had every right to be mad. Now I'm just confused because I feel unsure as to how upset I should be about this?? I was shocked because he told me so casually, like it was something he thought we could joke about. This is also incredibly out of character for him, he's never given me a reason to feel jealous or insecure in the past two years of our relationship. But this made me feel like shit. Does it matter that it happened over a year ago, and that he was never technically talking to any other girls in that way, and knows it was a mistake / was honest about it? I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around how much of dealbreaker this is, especially on the verge of starting long distance with him again."
550,"My relationship was very emotionally abusive early on. I stayed anyways. The emotional abuse ended. He has completely changed and has been a gentle and caring partner for the past 3 years. He's been great. But I have yet to move on from my hurt. Actually, my resentment and anger just seem to worsen as time goes on. 3 years is a long time to be mad about hurtful behavior that is no longer happening! How do I get unstuck from the narrative I've created for our relationship??? It's no longer accurate for me to view him as threatening and unaccepting, but that's how I feel nonetheless. I have yet to feel open and authentic around him. My resentment is constant. I'm desperate to feel different. I'm with someone who loves me, but I'm unable to feel loved. I'm so blocked by our past, and I replay it in my head all day. Every day, he shows me he's a good person, and I deeply admire his character. Yet here I am with a clenched heart.

Does anyone know any mental exercises I can do to let go of my outdated narrative? I don't think I need communication exercises. I've told him my grievances, and he's apologized for each individual memory. I don't think there's much else to ""communicate"" about. At this point, it's just about me letting go. Please, anything to help."
551,"We’ve been dating for more than 2 years now and even though we’re so young I feel that she’s the one for me.

It’s been more than a month since we moved to a new city for college,  and ever since then things have been spiraling down. It might be the difference in time we spent together (6 hours every day to maybe 3 or 4 times a week).  I also asked her if she’s lost interest in me or has gained feelings for another person. She denies this as well.

I asked her what was so wrong about us, and she mentions how we’re different from before, and how she wishes we went back to when we started dating.  This subject has been discussed about 3 times these past few weeks.

She claims that she loves me and knows I’m the one for her, I feel the same way but I’m growing anxious knowing I’m trying the best I can and seemingly no good results come from it.

I want to know what could I try to re-ignite the passion in our relationship.    Thanks for any input you might have ."
552,"So my(22M) gf(20F) has a friend we will call Alice. My girlfriend recently celebrated her birthday and her friend Alice was there to celebrate with us, along with some other people. I’ve met Alice before, she used to be really good friends with my gf, but with college starting for them and work picking up, they haven’t had much time for each other and have drifted apart somewhat. Alice is in a relationship, by the way, but she has an attention seeking personality. At the birthday party, Alice was joking around and saying things like I’m her fun boyfriend and the such. She is VERY comfortable around me. She lowkey flirts and get in my space and I don’t like it. 

Now today my gf said that that makes her uncomfortable and that she would like it if I was short and not overly friendly with her and I told her I would do as she asks. We’ve both been wanting to talk about boundaries recently so I figured now would be a good time to tell her some of mine then. I asked my gf that sometimes the way she interacts/lets her guy friends interact with her makes me uncomfortable, mainly the both of them saying and texting I love you’s, with one guy in mind in particular, which she knew exactly who I was talking about immediately. She said, earlier in the day, that if I had a problem with something she’d change it because I’m a priority and she’s spending the rest of her life with me, not them. Basically, 8 hours later, she told me to get over her doing that with him. I get it’s insecure of me, but is she not insecure with the “friendship” I have with her friend? I told her I’d completely change the way I act with her, even though I’ve done nothing wrong and my gf hasn’t even said anything to Alice yet, but after telling me she’d take my feelings into account on the same topic she goes and says no? I know that makes me seem insecure, and truthfully her saying I love you to a guy she doesn’t really bring around me does make me insecure. Should I bring this back up to her? Thanks"
553,"Hi everyone I have an issue I’m
Having a hard time getting past. 

I met a girl traveling and it was really good, then I had to leave for a bit but we were meeting up in 12 days and kept in contact. Anyways we stayed texting and she would always tell me that she missed me couldn’t wait until I was back and how crazy she was about me, then would disappear for a bit and go sleep with other guys. 

I know it’s not a big deal and everything and we weren’t officially dating or anything at the time so she is free to do what she wants. I just kinda feel like I was played, and I’m definately letting my issue ruin this here. 

Does anyone have advice on how I can suck it up and get over it or should I just move on. This was a month ago now and it’s starting to really bother me, even though at the time I just had the opinion that it is what it is."
554,"He works at my Uni, I think I’ve posted this before but like things are finally starting to open up a bit more. First, I’m not sure if the guy is awkward but he’s “accidentally” slipped his hand on my lap.  He and I exchanged numbers , today he helped me out with my car,  I gave him a hug for helping me but a friend of mine was standing there awkwardly when he saw us hug each other. It wasn’t like any hug I wrapped my arms around him and he was rubbing my shoulders. But at the same time as he got ready to leave he smiled at me and while leaving , mind you I am always catching him staring at me and smiling. There’s been a few instances I would be walking back from places and he’s staring at me and it’s almost like with a gaze. But every time I try to pursue over texts or something he never answers or replies. But in person he’s always down to talk. So I’m confused by this guy.
TLDR; he’s very confusing stares at me and smiles and interested in everything about me but literally never pursues anything over text. But is literally almost all over me in person. He also doesn’t have a girlfriend. So I’m a bit perplexed."
555,"So let me give a little context. My girlfriend and I, going on one year of dating and both 17, are in highschool and are college bound by the end of this school year. She is absolutely incredible, beautiful, sweet, fun, and we just understand each other. It’s like finding your best friend but not being trapped at a platonic level, truly a great relationship. 

The only problem is that the past few times i’ve gone to drop her off at her house after great dates, she’s started crying.  Every time for probably the past 5 dates.  I really try to comfort her and make her feel better but she gets very sad, saying that during and after college she won’t find someone that loves her like i do. I tell her that she is the greatest girl in the world and tell her exactly what i think about her, but it just makes her more sad because she says nobody will think that about her again.  We haven’t decided on what we’re going to do when we have to move away from each other yet.

It’s a very difficult position for me to be in; i don’t want to make any empty promises, and if we go to different areas i know that we’ll have to break it off.  If we go near each other i would be fine with it continuing, but it just seems unlikely.  Either way i’m at a loss for words, and it feels like anything that would make her feel better (telling her i’ll always be there for her/that i’ll always love her) would probably be a lie or an empty promise.  Its not that i don’t want either, it just isn’t practical. I love her and i just want her to be happy, but i know that she thinks about this continuously and it plagues her. Are there any suggestions on what i can do to help?

tl;dr: My gf (both of us 17, seniors) is scared that if we end up breaking up for college she will never find someone that connects with her like i do. it plagues her and she has cried when our last 5 dates have ended, what can I do about this?"
556,"So pretty much I started school this year with my theology class that meets 3 times a week and ever since week 3, I’ve noticed this one girl who sits in front of me and really had me head over heels. We ended up having a group discussion and she was in my group and she had her whole body facing me and seemed pretty engaged when I spoke. The next class, every time I raised my hand or spoke she would turn back to look at me, however she didn’t turn around or look at anyone else. We eventually had another group discussion and my group started getting off topic and we talked about ourselves a little bit. My college is a small college and typically commuter heavy, but I live about 3 hours away and I was recruited for Lacrosse. So when I mentioned where I was from to someone, she immediately questioned why I was even at this college, but I explained it. Then ever since that class, she started to laugh at the things I would say out loud in class, whether I meant it to be a joke or not. Then a few weeks later we had another group discussion and I kinda just joined their group because I had no other group to join. I got her to laugh and I noticed her body was pretty much facing me the entire time as well, but her arms were crossed. Then 2 minutes later when attendance was taken, I asked my professor how he was doing and he was so happy I asked him that, since it was the first time a student said that during attendance. Then when her name was called that same day, she then asked him how he was doing (which caught me off guard) even though she has only ever said “hi” when she was called. Then today in class, while she was taking off her jacket and putting it on her seat, she turned to me to do it. She’s typically done this but this was the first time I’ve caught her staring directly at me, and as soon as I looked at her she just turned around and that was that. Now I’m a really socially awkward person and I overthink everything, and I am really bad with picking up signals or anything from girls unless they are direct. But the question I wanted to ask is what do you guys think this means and what do you guys think I should do about it. I know some people might be like “oh this is so obvious” but I really don’t pick up signals or clues or anything, so I really don’t know what to do and I’ve been really confused about this for the last few weeks, and with more and more happening it’s hard for me to actually try and analyze. I really hope someone can help me, thank you for reading this message and have a good night!"
557,"So, I’m going to preface this with saying that my marriage is in distress. We have a lot of problems, that have been going on for a long time. We’ve been married 13 years. 

But, today I’m wondering if I’m overreacting. My husband will be gone all day at work, and sometimes attend an event afterwards, like a sporting or networking event, and he won’t check in. At all. Not even a quick text. I’ll be home taking care of our two small kids and it’s hard to believe he doesn’t even want to check in on them. Like, if it was the other way around, and I had been gone all day and hadn’t seen my kids, I’d be dying to find out how/what they were doing.

It really bothers/hurts me. I’ve mentioned it, and he still doesn’t do it. If I bring it up, he just blows it off and doesn’t even address the issue or my feelings. And I don’t even want him to check in out of obligation, it would be nice if he wanted to. Anyway, is this normal behavior? 

Tl;dnr:  My husband rarely texts to check in on me and our kids, even if he’s been gone all day, past work hours. It bothers me/is hurtful. Is that normal behavior?"
558,"Since you can infer most of the context from the letter itself, I won't write much of an intro. We dated for 2 months until she moved back overseas and now she's been gone for about 7 months. We agreed to stay in touch as friends after she moved but I'm still in love with her. I am 24 and she is 22. Here's the letter:

""Dear [her name],

I always get nervous before dates. I don’t go on many second dates because I’m typically a stuttering mess on the first one. I’m sure you could tell this when I picked you up on the night we met and I started blurting out random, stupid questions in a desperate attempt to avoid the awkward silence during the car ride. However, once we arrived at [bar name] and sat down, I noticed something different; I didn’t feel uncomfortable. I didn’t feel nervous. I didn’t run out of things to say. I felt like I was spending time with someone I had already known for a long time. Your smile and your laugh were so inviting; they made me feel at ease. Your stories were interesting. Your opinions were interesting. Your jokes were funny. You were so smart. We talked and drank for as late as we could before we started pushing the limits of being too drunk to drive back.

I couldn’t wait to see you again. Again, we went out drinking for as late as we could. We talked and talked and talked. I started telling you about my family. Problems with my job. Stresses in my life. These are things that I don’t even open up to my closest friends about, and here I was gushing to girl I had just met. When I dropped you off that night, we kissed for the first time, and looking back, I think that was the moment I fell in love with you.

You became the only thing I thought about. My first thoughts every morning would be “Did [her name] text me? Should I text her? No, I don’t want to text her TOO much, I’ll scare her off!” Images of your smiling face would play on repeat in my head all day. I didn’t get any work done those days. I was trying so hard to not mess things up with you that I nearly DID mess things up on the night we went back to my apartment. I thought I had blown it. I thought you would never talk to me again. I was so used to being cast aside for my stupid mistakes. But no; you saw past my stupidity and kept spending time with me. I cannot describe to you how happy that made me. After the next time we met up, I went home and cried.

When you told me that you had to go back to Germany soon, I was not surprised. I knew you had to return at some point, and a part of me had always thought that it was too good to be true that I met you in the first place. I started doing mental gymnastics to stop myself from being sad. She’ll come back after 6 months, right? Germany isn’t so far away, right? I quickly realized that I was lying to myself. We were walking very different paths in our lives, and the time for those paths to diverge was fast approaching. I was not prepared to confront this reality, so I did the only thing I knew how: I started to distance myself from you. I would begin texting you less frequently. I would ask to go out drinking with you less. I was preparing myself for the day that we would just be long distance friends, and that that was okay.

You went back to Germany, and again I told myself that it was okay. We didn’t know each other for that long anyway, right? There are plenty of other girls out there, right? I booted up Tinder and set up a date with another girl. It never had a chance of going well. When she smiled, I thought about how your smile was prettier. When she laughed, I thought about how your laugh was more pleasant. When she told a story, I thought about how you told better stories.

I had to get you out of my head. I couldn’t go on yearning for a girl who I could never have; it was killing me. So I began texting you less and less on WhatsApp, which was now our only method of communication. If I was going to move past you, I couldn’t have you on my mind. I couldn’t even talk to you. For a while, this worked. I thought about you less and less. You stopped texting me as well, so I was sure I was practically forgotten by now. I thought I had moved on. However, when I finally felt ready to try going on dates again, heartbreak hit me like a rogue wave. All the feelings I had been bottling up deep inside, pretending to not see for months, finally burst. My heart was broken. You are gone, and I will never see you again; I couldn’t accept that. I don’t want anyone else. None of them make me feel the same way as you. NOBODY has EVER made me feel the way I do about you.

The heartbreak hit me so badly that I had to leave work early today; I couldn’t focus on anything at all. There was no reason for me to be there. The only thing I could think about was how to stop the heartache. And there was only one solution I could think of: To tell you how I feel.

I am almost certain that I was not nearly as special to you as you were to me. I shouldn’t even need to ask. Unlike myself, you have known love before. While I have never had a successful long-term relationship, you are experienced in that regard. A short fling with an American boy during a temporary stay in the States likely registers as forgettable to you. Even if you did feel the same way, we are so far away, and I see no way we could become close anytime soon.

The only purpose of this letter is to make sure that I don’t have any regrets. I never told you what you meant to me, and I need you to know. Regardless of what happens after you read this, know that I needed to write it in order to move on with my life. What you feel after reading this letter, whether it’s sadness, joy, disgust, or apathy, I had to send it in order to move on with my life. 

Thank you for reading, and thank you everything, [her name].

-[my name]""

I know it's long, and I have a feeling it might be a really bad idea to send this, but I need to tell her how I feel. Please give me advice."
559,"I posted in the AITA but was told I would get more advice here.
English is not my first language. Sorry for mistakes. 

I am 24 and she is 20. We’ve been together for 1 year.

EDIT: I must add that all our clubs have dancers and it every night. Not a special show. And she was the one who wanted to go clubbing and made the reservation.

We were out clubbing with some friends of mine. In my country there are female dancers in clubs that are in their underwear usually or very little clothes.

Our table was infront of the stage.She was drinking and we were having until a dancer came on our stage. The dancers had this big fake boobss and big lips. She was dancing up there and my gf says “hey guys look at that frankeshtain”. They all looked at her weird and laughed and she started arguing with them “are you serious? Do you all find that attractive? Are you serious?”. I think the girl heard it too.

I told her to calm down and stop talking and she sort of pushed me and went outside the club. I went after her and she started acting like she is mad at me.  I told her that her attitude made me feel embarrassed and she started crying screaming at me.

I didn’t apologize but called her a taxi and waited her to get in. She texted me a short “got home but it’s not like you care”.

When I went in the club I felt so embarrassed infront of my friends. They asked where she is and a lied she didn’t feel well because of the alcohol.
We haven’t talked normal since then.

Did I do something wrong?"
560,"So I 28F, live with my BF, M28. We have had heating which we turned in at the beginning of the week. 

I knew it would smell for a bit when we first turned it on (I hate the smell) and went outside to read a book for a bit until is dissipated. No no deal right?

Nope.

The smell, a burn off gassy smell continued all evening. My boyfriend, who grew up with it, said it might take awhile until the dust burnt off. Ok. Except the smell was still coming in waves all evening. I asked if we could get a carbon monoxide detector just to make sure it was safe. So we got one, but he refused to open the windows or try to air out the house in any way because he said it was normal and I needed to just get used to it.

He left the next day to go out of town. I tried to deal with the smell for 2 or 3 more days. I had headaches. Would wake up like I couldn't breathe due to the smell. I finally couldn't take it anymore and shut off all the gas in the house I was so miserable. 

When spoke that evening I told him I shut off the gas and that I was hurt he didn't seem to care I was suffering and miserable. Asked why wouldn't couldn't have someone look at it. He said I was being difficult, there was nothing he could do so he didn't care. Like he wasn't willing to even try opening windows to air out the smell. I was terrified of going to sleep and not waking up.

I've had the gas off until someone comes back and checks it, but I feel like he has no concern for my safety, his own, or our pets. This is not the first time I have raised a concern and been told to deal with it. Reddit help. He comes back tomorrow and I'm pretty sure this is a deal breaker. 

TL;DR we have gas smell in house, boyfriend tells me to suck it up."
561,"I’m honestly not sure what to do now. I’m asking for advice and tips on what to do. 
From having a bad day yesterday to today. I’m lost and feeling so hopeless.
We been fighting on and off for days and he comes to tell me he doesn’t love me with such ease hurt. I just stayed quiet. Now we’re sleeping in separate room."
562,"So! Long story short, I had a horrible long drawn out break up a year and a half ago, which resulted in weight gain and me just feeling disgusting. Since this break up I haven't dated a single person. I used to fantasise about it when i was in my relationship, but when it actually came to it, I was so ashamed of my body I wouldn't let myself talk to guys, let alone flirt. I just got over a crush i had on this guy who wasnt interested, and im wondering if i should get with his friend who is keen. Or if id feel sad that it wasnt the guy i wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

A year and a half has passed, and although ive come out the other side and have learnt to look after myself, i have forgotten how to feel attractive, how to flirt, how to be anything other than someones friend. Will i even know how to have sex anymore lol?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, a friend of mine, who i had a massive crush on when i first met, but i had a boyfriend and he was in a relationship too, I think although we are friends that he is interested deep down. But i dont feel THAT attracted to him. I know all the boxes are there and he ticks all of them. Hes hot and sexy and funny and kind and intelligent and FUN, but I have only just got over a massive crush i had on his best friend. 

He keeps finding a way for us to hang out and i cancel, should i just do it so i can move on from this random bout of singledom?"
563,"sorry if this is scattered all over the place

about a half a year ago, me being 15 and never had a relationship before, a guy online said he liked me and said try a relationship and I thought alright ill try.

he lives in a different country and wants me to not have any physical contact until I'd move with him to that country.. abandoning everything I have where I live.

so I feel like I'm missing out on teenage dating

he is nice but it feels like the negatives are outnumbering the positives...

he said once that no one else will love me besides him, that's why we'll ""stay together forever"", reacts badly to the answer ""no"", he acts mean and different in front of other people, then says he doesn't understand why they don't like him, gets jealous of me talking to my guy friends (who I have known before him), he has made me sad on multiple occasions.

I don't know if I actually ""love"" him. he kinda forced the ""I love you"" out of me and I guess it's just a habit we say it now.

everything has changed now since I've gotten a job. there's a boy who likes me, and I actually think I like him too. but since this crush has developed I've been beating myself up over it because my mind is telling me that I'm cheating on the online bf. I've now discovered that the new job boy treats me so much better and I feel so good for once.

I'd hate to break up with online bf because I know it will break his heart, and he's been nice to me too, but I feel like I have a chance at actually being happy and not physical affection being years away.  


I still want to be friends with him and everything, I like hanging out with him and his friends."
564,"Buckle up, because this is going to be a very confusing situation. In order for this story to make any sense, I need to start by introducing everyone that is involved, including myself, a 18 y/o male.

Let's start with my dad, the main issue here. I will be using fake names after the relationship to me and this situation.

Dad: we can call him Tim. (Also my boss.) - Works at 2 different agencies - Rarely see him anymore due to work.Step Mom: let's call her Samantha (Not actually my step mom, just call her that to make it easier, they never got married.)Boss: call her Jess. (Works with my dad very closely)Co-Worker1: we can call her Beth. (I work with her 2/3 days I work for 12+ Hours) (Also works with my dad at the other job he has, he recruited her to the job where he is the boss of me at) (Was also my teacher for a CTE class, she's probably around 23?)

Now that we have a baseline down in the relationship these people all have to me, this is where it starts to get complicated. My dad and step mom decided to break up, they have for the most part kept it low from family and stayed to themselves... That is until Samantha, my old step mom, got a home of her own recently after the break up.

So recently I got a job under my dad (sorta) where I work with my old teacher, Beth, which I considered her more of a friend, we got along quite well and it wasn't really that 'teacher' type of person. I had known her previously because she worked with my dad. That being said we talk all the time and make jokes and whatnot... Now I know what you are thinking I have a crush on her, blah blah blah, but it is **not** like that at all. Matter in fact, it's quite opposite. Everything was going well today until I get a phone call from Samantha today at work, and I could she is or was crying... This is where it gets *really* awkward, I tell her ""Hey one second, I need to wait until Beth gets back before I can leave to talk to you, can I call you back in 2 minutes?""So I wait until Beth gets back, I tell everyone I was working with I needed to take an important phone call and excused myself out the front. This is when Samantha starts to cry to the point where she is inaudible. She starts explaining a situation that everything just sort of clicked.Basically, to make things short, Samantha, my old step mom, would do anything for my dad. That being said, he wanted a 3 sum with his worker, Beth (and my teacher/friend). Samantha was losing my dad slowly and knew it was happening, so she agreed to make him happy, when he started doing the deed, my step mom instantly felt uncomfortable and wanted them to stop... However it didn't just stop, both, Beth and my dad, wanted to keep going and my dad continued to do it with Beth, right in front of Samantha. Matter in fact, he did it multiple times, and started to do it when they were alone together. (and who knows when else). Now I have to go back into work and sit in front of the person that is quite frankly obsessed with my dad (she tells her friends stories and talks about my dad all the time, regardless of her having a boyfriend.) This is just super awkward for me at this point, as you could probably assume, and I knew nothing of it for months.When Samantha explained this to me, it all started to make sense, I never thought more of it because Beth was just a friend, co-worker, and my teacher...

(She didn't become my co-worker until maybe 2-3 weeks ago, my dad had recruited her over and she started to work at the agency that he is now in charge of)

Samantha goes on to tell me the rest of the story, and it doesn't stop there, my dad was also having relations with another co-worker of his, at the job he wasn't a boss of. Ultimately, this is where my step mom drew the line, she cut everything off with my dad but still loves him deeply and this is hurting her way more than it is for my dad. To make matters worse, my dad ALSO hired this girl that he had this relation with at his job that he is a boss of. She is also bragging about having this one night with him to people my old step mom works with, she is getting the shittiest of shit cards dealt recently.

Now, if things weren't interesting enough, here I go making it more confusing. My dad also is starting to date my other boss, Jess, who is overall the head of my position. I had always thought why she treated me so much better than everyone else and was always on my side, and it all started to make sense when my brother, who is in the military, was visiting and we went to a concert and she tagged along. Not only did she tag along, she was ALL over my dad. Now I notice when she comes over 'for work' it is WAY more than that. Personally I hate this, my old step mom, Samantha, will ALWAYS be that mom figure for me in my life.

Oh and one more super important thing, my dad is taking leadership classes for this **huge** job opening that would ultimately result in him moving **when** he gets the job offer. I am personally living rent free (for now) and under his insurance, he hasn't told me he is going to be moving, but he had drunk text Samantha this one night and she told me so I would be ready for worst case. This means WHEN he moves, I will be kicked out.

There's other stories that are included in this that fit into the timeline, however it doesn't affect the story too much so I will cut them out for the sake of time.

To add a little bit extra, I personally love Samantha, she is always there for me and she is even letting me get a dog at her new house (which my dad hates her for because he refuses to let me have one here, he even called her today to tell her she's fucked up for doing that and to 'fuck off') and I know this seems small but I am alone basically every day, and I'm getting lonely, I need something, so this is huge for me.

I honestly just don't know what to do anymore and I was hoping someone with an outside view could help me out... I feel lost, lonely, and quite frankly don't know what to do anymore. Thanks if you got this far and actually understood the story, it was a wild one.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My dad fucked someone, ended up being a close(ish) someone to me, crushed my step mom, dating my boss now, hired 2 girls he fucked at his other job, and god knows what else.."
565,"&amp;#x200B;

So, i was in park with my girlfriend and randomly a guy appeared, he was walking over there for a while and suddenly just came and sat on the bench with us. i asked him friendly why is he here and what he wants, he told me that my brother swore at him and that i swore at him too some time ago, and that he will fight me right there if i don't stop with all of those things, which is not true, i never saw this guy before and he probably just wanted to bother us for some reason, i will mention that the guy is gypsy, i am not racist or anything, i don't have anything with gypsy people but just so you know they are very rude and aggressive in my country \*European Country\*. That's why i tried to keep myself calm as i could and he even wanted to fight me right in front of my girlfriend, i admitted everything he said even if it was not true just by the fact i didn't want to fight in front of my girlfriend, otherwise i would have punched that guy but after i would probably make more problems with gypsy people like him.

I am feeling very ashamed and bad because this guy went over us and started swearing, even he swore at her and i wasn't able to do any move because i would have felt bad for fighting with a random guy right in front of my girlfriend, we just wanted to have a peaceful night together :("
566,"Hey, new here, purely made an account to seek advice about this situation I'm in. I've been with my gf for over 8 months and I love her to bits.

Before I met my her, I had confidence oozing out my ears because I was in a decently popular ""chad"" friendship group and was thriving off a lot of outside attention. I was in my prime and felt strong where I was with admirers left and right. After a year or so I felt the urge to get serious again and that it was time to drop the big ego fuckboy stage. I feel deep down I've always been a hopeless romantic and I know truly I'm a softy wanting love. Queue dating my gf.

With trust and loyalty, I cut ties with all the thots that wanted to get into my pants and were only around to boost my ego. I loved my gf and we had amazing times together, she was all I needed now. It was great! I was happy, we were both making waves.

***So the initial problem:*** I got incredibly ill right before our first holiday together. We're about 4 months in to the relationship and it's the earliest I can pinpoint the problems. I developed really bad anxiety out of the blue, which is incredibly strange for myself to go through. I'd never been a nervous guy before, I lost my appetite and I really had to fight to get my mental state back on track. While I was struggling, this was the first time my gf had ever really seen me weak and somewhat depressed. She began distancing herself from me rather than helping me recover. She wasn't really attempting to cheer me up, complimenting me, all the usual reassuring stuff she'd often do in the relationship before. I've made a full recovery from my illness thanks to meds, but things haven't really been the same since.

I don't think she knows how to deal with it. Her ex from what I heard was very cocky and didn't need any validation. But since I was knocked down a peg or two I've really been craving love from her. I have brought it up a few times but me trying to talk about it tends to send her in the other direction. I feel like her seeing me vulnerable makes her love me less unintentionally because I come across as needy. We've had talks where we both agree I've changed emotionally and I'm no longer on the same page as I used to be. I even broke up with her a few days ago because it really got to me. I got my mojo back during the break so we're trying again. I know she loves me, I just don't feel good enough sometimes.

At the moment I try to tell myself I never used to get upset with the attention she gave me and I feel like I'm valuing things differently? How do I get back into a healthier mindset so we can go back to easier days of loving?

***TL;DR*** \- My mindset has changed poorly and I focus too heavily on how much attention I get. How do I work myself back out of it?"
567,"Ok so to give some background info my S/O and I went to highschool together, we had a thing for eachother but nothing ever happened. Fast forward to 5 years later , he hits me up on fb , he had just broken up with his then gf and was looking for a rebound hookup and I had also just broken up with a bf at the time so I was also looking for some rebound dick. Anyway we talk for about a week and then finally met up and hooked up (I had planned on never speaking to him again after that night because I had other dudes I was interested in and he was just some rebound dick) anyway 2 weeks later I start feeling all sick and I was very very late so I took a test (not expecting anything of it because of previous health issues I was told it would be incredibly difficult for me to conceive) and found out I was 2 weeks preggo , went to the docs to confirm and yep defs preggo. I decided to let him know that I’d be keeping it and didn’t expect anything from him, just wanted to let him know on the off chance that he wanted to be in his child’s life. Surprisingly enough he made it very clear he wanted to be involved in his child’s life. I agreed that it would be fine and that the only thing I expected from him to was to be there for his child like he said he would, I didn’t want his money or anything. Throughout the pregnancy he contacted me a few times to check up on the baby but we both were doing our own thing and seeing other people. Anyway 3 months before baby is born he started txting me every day and talking to me as if we were a couple ,I replied as I would reply to a friend , making it clear that I wasn’t about to just date him because of a baby we have together. Anyway fast forward , I start getting feelings for him and agreed to move in together. Now we live together with our 4 month old son. We both love eachother but it feels like we rushed everything , skipped the whole early stages of a relationship and now live together. 
Anyone in a similar situation ? Need some advice because even though we r already living together we r still trying to take our time and let the relationship grow."
568,"So I had my friend secretly add this guy that I’m talking to just so I can see what he’s up to without him knowing but he ended up finding out because she posted me on her story. He texted me, “how did your friend get my snap.” I’m so embarrassed literally I don’t know how to get out of this situation."
569,"I’m going to put it straight- I’ve been in a serious relationship for almost 4 years and my current boyfriend is perfect. He is also my first serious boyfriend, and he is absolutely wonderful and was the one to help me out of my depression and anxiety. If I did have to talk about the negatives, we do get into arguments like every other couple and he is closed off (more than I like). I feel like I’m the one to do most of the talking in the relationship and four years in, I still feel like I’m missing major chunks of his life. He doesn’t really tell me things, it’s always along the lines of ‘my life is boring and normal, I have nothing to tell you’. But I tell him that I want to hear about the boring things and that it doesn’t matter whether it’s interesting or not. 

So a little backstory, I actually found someone else attractive before meeting my current boyfriend. Now, this year, I reconnected with this so-called crush and I really started to get to know him better through a couple social events that we both went to. We slowly got to know each other and we got along really well. We found out that we have a lot in common and I truly enjoyed his company and his friendship. When he was telling me that he also was going through depression and anxiety, my heart really opened up for him. I was confused why he was telling me all of these things when I barely knew him, but I went along with it and just wanted to be a good friend to him. He was funny, open, and refreshing. But at some point I really started to like him. 

Because me and my boyfriend are very open to each other I immediately told him that I started to like this guy or well, attracted to him. Of course, my boyfriend wasn’t happy to hear that I was thinking about another man. But in my defense I was convinced that having a crush is normal that you can be attracted to someone while being in a relationship. It wasn’t that I was going to make a move on my so-called crush. 

But the arguments between me and my boyfriend continued. He didn’t like me and my crush talking to each other and being friends. It got to the point where it was starting to affect me to say the least. 

So, there was another social event where my crush was going to attend. My boyfriend told me to stay away from him, and That it’s probably not good for me to be around him when I like him. But I still went anyway. The night was going smoothly and I was avoiding my crush all throughout. However, at some point during the night (we were all drunk) and him and I started talking. We started cuddling, and giggling. I told him I liked being in his arms, and he agreed. I gave him a kiss on the cheek, he kissed my forehead and we didn’t let go of each other for a little while. He knows that I had a boyfriend, but he asked if I wanted to go back to my place. That’s when it hit me. And then, he quickly realized and said ‘aren’t you with someone?’ And I said yes. But he asked again ‘Let’s go back to yours’. I didn’t respond this time because it hit me. Finally he said ‘I don’t want to get in between you and your boyfriend’ and that’s when I confessed that I really liked him and found him attractive. But again he replied ‘I’ll help you get over me’ and that was the end of that. 


We continued to hug, and my friend realized what was happening and  pulled me away. I came home and balled my eyes out. We apologized to each other through text and he made sure I was home safe. But all I could think of for that night and the next couple weeks is what would’ve happened if I had brought him home. I think if anything, my feelings grew even more. 

He never spoke to me after that and it really hurts. I felt guilty that I’m putting him before my boyfriend who btw has also been nothing but understanding in this whole situation. 

It’s been several months and I still think about my crush. The thing is- I would be happy if he got a girlfriend. I just want him to be happy. 

I don’t want to imply that I’m unhappy with my current boyfriend but my crush and I had a good friendship going and I really feel like I ruined it. 

Not only did I ruin my trust with my boyfriend, but also a good friendship. 

I’m not sure what to do or think in this situation. My boyfriend and I are doing great, but at the back of mind I wish I never did what I did. I wish I stayed within my bounds and never told my crush I liked him. Now, I’m regretting everything and don’t know what to do??"
570,"Teammate will be named TM

I am on a high school robotics team with many members, and every year we have to try out for Captain positions. I am sharing a overall Captain position with TM, and she can get away with almost anything. To start off, she is a really passionate, motivated individual, but also very self-centered. She runs from responsibility often, claims credit from others by doing very small tasks, and is overall disrespectful to any other students. The issue is that when we bring up these issues, she runs to an adult and claims we are antagonizing her. They believe her, and we get in trouble for her actions. For example, at a world's level championship that we qualified to, a part of our robot broke (her system), and she ran out for 4 hours. She was the one in charge of keeping the robot and crew running smoothly. She was not criticised for it, but when another teammate (male) left for 30 minutes, he was yelled at and almost demoted. 

I don't want to remove her, or get her in trouble, she has amazing potential on this team, I just want to help her be a better person. ANY advice is helpful. Thanks!

TLDR: Title"
571,"Last night me and my boyfriend of 6years had a couple drinks and then laid down to go to bed. He was a little drunk and got handsy and I said that I didn't wanna have sex. (Some context: I've been abused in the past and sometimes I want to be intimate without having sex because I get scared easily, it's something I'm working on in therapy.) Any way, he said ""well can we just kiss then? I promise I won't push it farther I just wanna be close"" and I agreed because it sounded really nice. 
Anyway, we're kissing and it ends up getting hot and heavy so I told him that I changed my mind if he was into it and I wanted to have sex, and he agreed.
Fast forward, we're laying down afterwards, just talking and he said he was glad I changed my mind because ""I have a bad habit of seeing how far I can push things, and I figured if we were making out, I could push until oral and then push until we had sex"". I told him immediately how disgusted I was that he said that and that he did that, because at the time I felt very in control of the situation and I felt played. I feel really gross about this and I'm nervous about the future if this is something he apparently does. I never expected this out of him and now I feel like I can't trust him. 
Am I allowed to feel this way? He apologized and said he shouldn't have said it because he was drunk and that's not how he really feels, but why would he say it if that's not how he feels? I feel really gross about the situation and he keeps apologizing but I don't know how to move forward from this. Help?"
572,"I’ve been sick and stuck in the house for months and I just wanna hang out with my older brother. He lives at home, has high functioning autism, and takes care of my sick mom.

We weren’t close until a few years ago (and by close I mean regularly talk to each other and socialize) and I’m still trying to figure out what activities we should do to hang out.

We don’t really like the same video games, we watch different anime, and just have different taste"
573,"It’s a new relationship (2 months in) and I really like her. However she tells me all of her friends are male. She snapchats them every day. She says that girls are too much work. She can have guy friends, that’s no problem, is just that a lot of the friends she has are people she has hooked up with or has shared feelings with. 2 of the guys she told me about sounds like they had some very serious feelings for one another a while ago. She’s a very open person and I appreciate it. She tells me when random people message her trying to get with her. I trust her but it just makes me a bit uncomfortable. Am I just being too insecure and jealous?"
574," I’ve been officially dating this girl for a week, but we’ve been going on dates and having sex for a little over a month now. For a lot of the time before we officially started dating she was at my house and has been at my house everyday all day (except for when she was at work) since we officially started dating. We get along really well and I enjoy her company almost more than anything, but I’m the kind of person that needs to be alone sometimes. 

 She’s been going through a lot recently like getting kicked out of her parents house, almost getting kicked out of her current house, and losing a very close friend (not dead, they just decided to end the friendship). At her current house there’s water damage in what was supposed to be her room so she has to sleep on the couch there which hurts her back a lot since she has slight scoliosis so I feel bad whenever she’s has to sleep there instead of in my big comfy bed. 

 I’m a very introverted person so when I spend several days straight without any alone time it really wears me out, and it’s very obvious. I start getting distant and I’m tired all the time and just seem like I’m in a bad mood all day. I’d say for every 2-3 days I spend with someone continuously I need at least two days to myself. 

 How can I tell her this without making her feel bad or like I don’t want her? Should I make a schedule? Or should we just decide where she stays on a day to day basis? I don’t mind if we hang out during the day as long as she stays the night at her house. And some nights I would still want her to be here. I’m just so tired. 

 tl;dr recently starting dating a girl who wants to be together 24/7 but it’s draining me and i need alone time and I don’t know how to tell her."
575,"Should I make a first move?

I (18F) have a very big crush on a boy (19M) I met at the library. 
It all started a month ago when I was casually working at the library and then I started noticing that a boy sitting some tables in front of me kept staring at me from time to time, then as it got really late he left with his friend and gave me that sad but promising look that I’ll never forget. 

Ever since, I was trying so hard to meet him again. And a week ago, as midterms came, he started appearing at the library way to often, and now it happens that we always study at the very same spot. 

I can see him giving me that looks and smiles but I don’t know what it all means. I even found him on insta and followed him there. He followed me back. I texted him and tried to start a casual conversation, however, he answers once in a while. Sometimes it even takes up to 2 days.... however, every time he sees me, he seems excited. Is it all midterms or he’s just not interested ?

Should I be more clear in my intentions and ask him out right away? What If he has a girlfriend and I’m overestimating all these looks and  grins?

TLDR: I have a crush on a boy from the library that stares at me all the time but doesn’t make the first move (although I’ve already made)."
576,"Background: My boyfriend (23) and I (24) have been dating for a year, most of which has been long distance - it is a long story but we have been amazingly good pals online for 4.5 years prior to dating.

I have just started my first real career as a registered nurse last month that wants their new nurses to stay for the company a total of 3 years. I wasn't granted a sign on bonus for this (so I won't owe money if I left early) and the hope we new grads stay is not entirely strict. I am in CA and my man is in PA. I had this job lined up since April before graduating in Aug and was able to get my dream job/unit.

 So we have an issue on who will be moving... He had at first made comments as though he wouldn't mind living here with me. But suddenly he has now decided to NOT move for me otherwise I would lose respect for him if he cannot find a job.. Yet he wants ME to uproot my life for him when I have nothing saved and am not established as he is. I already moved 5 hours away from home to work. And I must admit I love the atmosphere and learning potential here - I can see myself staying the full 3 years.. Minimum 2... Though he is so adamant that he will not go here and if I don't move for him then I must not love him..

We have gone back and forth about this a lot.. I initially thought of going to PA if I didn't pass my boards exam on time for this job. But by the universe, I did and therefore felt it was a sign that I was meant to go here.. Get stable, save some money, pay off college debt and then move with work experience. I understand he is hurt I didn't chose to run off with him. It is just hard to convince him that just because I am doing somthing for myself, something I have worked hard for 6 years, doesn't mean I love him any less. Maybe I am being selfish hoping he will move here since he has more saved and jobs are easier to come by here. In any case, I am just feeling hurt that he makes me feel guilty about choosing career over love. 

We are serious about marriage, he even knows what ring he will get for me. It is just a matter of time when we will finally settle and live our life together physically versus visiting. It just seems as though he can't wait 1 to 2 years or 3.. A guy has needs I guess... I wouldn't mind leaving the job ... But a year may be too soon and I'd hate to do the company wrong for giving me this opportunity. Then when you think about it.. If I leave, an employer only sees you as another body for work. And I really want this man to be it until death.

 I just don't know what to do and am torn.. Any words of wisdom from the wiser? 
Thanks ❤"
577,"First I must say that its a LDR relationship.

I really love her. I love her more than anything. She's been on my mind nonstop ever since being together. She's had a bad past. Her father is a murderer, had an older person touch her, and had to move to live with an abusive grandmother, who never fed her, or treated her like a human. No birthdays, no dinner, no nothing. She did a lot of cutting in the past. No one deserves to go through what she went through. I loved her before she even told me this, but now all I want to is give her the love and support she needs. Awhile ago she moved in with her sister, and has been doing better. She's had some past relationship troubles, too. Her last one was with a guy who manipulated, stalked, and hurt her. She's told me time and time again that I'm the only thing keeping her going. I want to move in with her, be with her and eventually marry her. We've discussed that stuff over and over again. We usually only play league or minecraft together. She doesn't have a lot of friends, so last week when she was playing with some friends I was really happy for her. I want her to enjoy playing with them. However, it became me waiting for the entire night wanting to play with her. They were taking hours and hours together. We did talk, but I was upset being unable to spend some time with her. Last Thursday we got into a fight about it, and then kind of made up. Then the exact next day I was wanting to play with her, and she was playing with her friends again and I got really upset. I've never been angry, or yelling at her or that type of stuff, just really upset, and it brought me to tears hearing that she didn't want to play with me. I did something that reminded her of her ex, and then she said she needed some time to think. I talked to a few people on discord about it, and then today I messaged her. I don't want to hurt her feelings. I made a mistake. I've apologized profusely. It honestly really breaks my heart knowing that she doesn't want to be with the one thing that kept her going anymore. I feel like a failure for that. I want to continue it... I don't want to give up on her. I love her. I don't want to be another thing that hurt her in the past. I don't want anyone or anything else. Just to be with her... My heart is racing, I'm crying and just trying not to lose her. I don't want to say the wrong thing... I can't just hug and kiss her like I'd want to if I was there... I know money can't buy love but is there anything I can do to help her able to continue?

&amp;#x200B;

update: she just blocked me on discord... i feel like a failure at the moment. I lost the only person who I really loved..."
578,"I’m a 19 year old male who just graduated from high school. From my freshman year to my senior year I have had many crush’s but when I start to get close to them and going to ask to go to prom or homecoming or something,I always find something I dislike about them and then my feelings for them disappear. I feel like this is why I’ve never been in a relationship. Does anyone have advice for what I can do?"
579,"My girlfriend and I have been encountering the biggest bumps we’ve ever had to deal with in our relationship. Things haven’t been working out, and we have had talks about this many times now.

For the last month, my girlfriend has checked off everything on the “subtle signs she’s going to break up with you” articles. She has became less interested in the conversations we have, she has been picking a lot more fights with me, she has dropped the intimacy in our relationship, she doesn’t go out with me as much, she criticizes me a lot more often, and she has stopped putting in effort towards us.

All of this was pretty hard to cope with, especially when our relationship was going downhill. But I mean, our relationship was probably going downhill because of this. She was pulling away from me and I didn’t know why. So, we eventually confronted some issues and I eventually got to telling her that I feel this distance from her and it’s been sucking. I was very nice and mature about it. In addition, one night she admits that the relationship has been going severely downhill. She said something that makes me 100% sure that she is about to break up; “I want things between us to work out, but honestly I don’t think it can. We’ve been through something like this more than once”. So at this point, I thought we broke up. I still asked “so what does this make us”, and she told me she’s “obviously not breaking up with me”. After that she was fully aware of my anxiety towards her dumping me. She would sometimes reassure me that she isn’t going to break up, but it always felt like lies. Even recently, she admitted “when we talked about us growing up together I realized it was all just a fairytale”. But I think after she says something like that she instantly feels bad and tells me she doesn’t want to break up. However, she has been saying “let’s give this one more shot”. I think she’s scared of hurting me. She’s really that type of person.

I don’t know what to do in this situation because I’d never want to be stuck in a relationship like this. She knows how anxious I am towards this. I just always feel like she’s not telling the truth. I get vibes that she’s not interested in me anymore, and that our relationship is broken for her. How do I get her to admit that she wants to break up with me?"
580,"I (23f) had a really long, emotional and exhausting day and I was really looking forward to spending some time with my boyfriend (28m) tonight since I didn’t really get to see him yesterday. So I get home and make this big dinner and I’d really like to just relax with him once we got the kitchen cleaned up but he wants to play a video game. He kind of asked me if it was okay and I didn’t really say anything, which I know is on me. I just don’t want to sound controlling like I’m making him not play. I’m just more sensitive about it today because I haven’t gotten good sleep in about a week and there’s a lot going on in my personal life at the moment. I’m feeling super overwhelmed right now and I really would have liked to spend some time with him today and talk about it  (especially because of not seeing him yesterday, like I said above.). Again, I just don’t want to come off controlling or possessive and have him interpret me being stressed as me being angry with him. Help please. 

TLDR: how to ask my boyfriend to stop playing video games without sounding controlling and possessive?

EDIT: I 100% acknowledge that I should have said fine thing to begin with but I guess I should be more clear. I’m asking now that he’s been playing for like an hour and I’m going to sleep soon how do I ask him to stop and come talk or chill with me for a bit?

UPDATE: just wanted to update and say thanks for all the helpful answers (and some not so helpful ones). I texted him and asked him to come hang out for a bit before I went to sleep and that I was really overwhelmed. He actually didn’t see it but came up about 10 minutes later anyways. All is good 😊 I just need to speak up more"
581," 

My partner and I have been dating for about two years.

Necessary backstory: I met my partner while I was married. My ex-wife, myself, and my current partner all worked at the same company. Wife and I had been married since we were both 18, so 8 years. We can call my ex-wife Amanda, and my partner Meagan. Amanda and I had a toxic relationship, likely never should have been married, but made it work for a long time. We both had substance abuse issues, hers were prescription pills and mine was alcohol.

Amanda and Meagan were pretty close coworkers and friends. Meagan got ill when we were all working together, and had to miss a week of work. She wasn't at risk of losing her job over it, but did miss out on a week's worth of pay, and because of \*that\*, was evicted from her apartment. Amanda invited Meagan to come and live with us, which I was averse to. I do not like having people I don't know in my personal space (home). Regardless, under the assumption that Meagan wouldn't be living with us for long, just a place for her to crash until she got back on her feet, I acquiesced and she moved in.

Amanda and I argued, probably more than ""normal"" couples. We argued independently of Megan living there, but her living there did exacerbate some of our problems. Amanda and I would find Meagan taking the side of either of us during or after argument. I admittedly found comfort in venting to Meagan, and after a while, she became something of a confidant/therapist-like person to me. We started sleeping with each other 3-4 months after she moved in, Amanda unaware. After maybe the second or third time we slept together, I couldn't tolerate my own guilt and told Amanda. We decided that the best course of action was divorce amicably. She wasn't happy that I'd cheated, obviously, but she also said that it was somewhat of a relief because it was a ""valid"" reason for us to divorce.

So, we divorced. I moved out a few days after Amanda and I talked, and because Meagan and I were already sleeping together, we started a relationship with me, and she immediately moved in with me to my new apartment.

Our relationship also seemed alright at first, but the longer we've been together, the more toxic we seem to get with each other, far worse than the toxicity between Amanda and I.

Last October, Meagan told me she was pregnant. I was nervous, but moreover excited. I've desperately always wanted children. Amanda couldn't have children. I was elated at the prospect of being a father. Late November of 2018, Meagan miscarried. Our doctor said that as early as it was in the pregnancy, miscarriages are extremely common. Meagan, however, thinks that I caused her to miscarry because two days before the miscarriage we had semi-rough sex. Any time we have a big enough argument, she tells me that I'm the reason she lost her baby, that I don't get to be upset by her telling me that because it was my fault. This is incredibly hurtful to me, and so I cry, and she tells me things like ""Shut the fuck up"" or ""You're 28, you're a grown man, get over yourself"".

Megan works 10 minutes away from where we live. She works in a daycare and makes $9.25/hr, 40 hours a week. I work in as a manager in fast food making $11.75/hr, and get between 30 and 40 hours a week depending on how late I stay past my shift every day. Our schedules usually match up so that I get off in time to pick her up for her lunch (30 mins). Today was particularly busy and I had to stay over 10 extra minutes so that I could count down my employees change belts. When I picked her up, she was incredibly unhappy with me. Upon her getting in the car, I started to apologize to her for being late, she was short with me and said ""I don't want to hear it, you're late, I don't care what your excuse is""

I again tried to apologize and she cut me off. I asked her to please not be angry with me, and she said ""I'm not pissed off at you but I can be if you want me to"". I tell her that I don't want that, apologize again for being late, and tell her that if she's that upset she should just stay at work.

The next 30 minutes consisted of her screaming at me, me apologizing for being there late, her telling me that me being late isn't why she's angry at me, me asking exactly why she's angry with me, and her responding with something like ""Stop fucking talking to me"" or ""I already told you what I wanted"" or ""I'm not doing this with you anymore"" or ""go fuck yourself you fucking retard"" or ""actually kill yourself"". Her saying things like this is pretty common. She always apologizes later and says things like ""I'm sorry that you elicit that response from me sometimes. I used to just say that it's okay, because I just want to be around her and cuddle with her, but it's really getting old. I have major depressive disorder and the constant personal attacks don't do a lot for my mental well-being. I truly love Meagan, but I feel that our relationship is too toxic to continue on it's current trajectory. I start therapy (after 5 years of being out of it) next month, because I just got health insurance for the first time in a long time. Meagan has health insurance but doesn't want to do to a therapist/psychiatrist and instead opts to continue taking the same Wellbutrin/Buspar prescriptions she's had since she was 16.

Discussing our problems, even when in a calm, state, leads generally to arguing if I bring something up to her -- or me zoning out and ignoring her when she brings something to me. I can't say why we argue when I bring something up to her, but I can say that I zone out and stop listening to her because I feel like I'm putting in a ton of work into our relationship to change myself and rewire my brain so that I'm more who she wants me to be and less who I actually am, and what I get back is screaming, yelling, her telling me that my best attempt isn't good enough. She takes off her engagement ring every time we argue and throws it. Whenever she puts it back on she makes some rude remark like ""I have to fucking wear this or my coworkers will ask me why I took it off""

She says things to me, when things arent' heated or we've calmed back down like ""I'm sorry I'm so vile to you"" and then will cry and want me to comfort her because she doesn't like the way she speaks to me, or because she's broken my glasses again, or because she hit me and broke one of my teeth, or whatever other reason she might have for apologizing.  


Edit: I'm not without fault. I respond defensively immediately to any slight amount of anger. If she's angry with me, my responses aren't helpful. As evidenced by me telling her that maybe she should stay at work if she was that angry with me. True, it would've shirked me of the ""responsibility"" of dealing with her anger, but I guess that also isn't fair to her."
582,"My girlfriend (f19) doesn't seem to love or care for me (m19) anymore.

We have been dating for a little over a year now (we had been best friends before we started dating) and everything had been going perfect untill about 4 months ago. 

(Side note, I do have depression and anxiety, this is important for the post)

Slowly she stopped kissing me, hugging me, cuddling in bed with me &amp; having sex with me. Now I know that relationships aren't all about sex but it's been 4 months since we had. These aren't the only problems, she has started to snap at me for the smallest things, any mistake I make she snaps at me for. 

I have told her how I feel about her snapping at me but she didn't seem to care about what I had to say.

1 week ago I told her that I had been depressed really badly recently and all she had to say was ""You are always depressed, you make everyone around you depressed, that's why no one wants to be around you"".
I was and am speechless.

I don't know what to do, because of a previous abusive relationship I have issues confronting problems with females but I can see that this relationship is slowly turning into a toxic relationship.

Please help"
583,Like of course im gonna get him something he likes but also i wanna get something different as well such as a board game or craft thing. Any ideas??
584,"My ex left me for another girl. However, he wanted to be friends. I knew this wasn’t the best thing to do so I decided to quit contacting him and ignore him. It drove him NUTS. He kept on begging me to talk to him. I remember giving in to his emotions and telling him we were still friends. He eventually saw through it when I started to ignore him again. He was so unhappy. He said he missed what we used to have together. He misses being my favorite person. He misses being a high priority in my life. He misses when I was excited to talk to him. However, I TRIED explaining to him that he’s not my bf anymore so he has to adjust. Then, he complains that my new relationship will make him forget about him. He seems jealous and he keeps on telling me and himself it’s a rebound. 

He tells me he just really wants to be friends with me... but he’s giving me mixed signals that he’s into me. Then, he said when we were friends before we dated that he was still my favorite person and a high priority (which is true). He then complains that he doesn’t like how he’s “just a friend I talk to sometimes” now. Is he into me or does he just genuinely want to be best friends?"
585,"I’ll admit up front that I might just need to hear the obvious answers here.

But anyway, I was involved in a whirlwind romance with a guy who I felt drawn to from the moment I laid eyes on him. We connected deeply and quickly and he decided to move across the country with me. We were apart for four weeks until his affairs were in order and he made the drive to live with me.

After a month of being incredibly happy, I found his old phone and found out he had done some very hurtful things before he left his home state, several things I explicitly told him I wasn’t okay with at the very beginning of our relationship, and all but cheated on me (he insists nothing physically happened).

He continued to lie until he realized I knew everything, and has been apologetic since then. He took over cooking dinner and doing the dishes (etc) when I fell into depression afterward, and helped me pack, break the lease on our apartment, and move back in with my mom nearby. He continuously told/tells me how sorry he was/is, and maintains that he is different now, and that he had always intended to be different when we moved in together.

He moved back home, and it has been a few days but we are still in contact. He keeps telling me that he loves me so much, that he wants to find a way to be together again, and that he wants another opportunity. I feel that my trust has been shattered, because the things emphasized most in our early conversations were honesty, trust, and communication.

I know it sounds dumb to post about, but I love him so much. He has always told me he has never been married because he was waiting for someone special, and I have avoided relationships in recent years because I only wanted to be with someone that I could see myself marrying, and in a lot of ways he is a very unique person.

Is there any hope for our relationship? Is it possible to rebuild trust after such a betrayal? Is it wise to even consider it? Should I just cut my losses and stop talking to him?"
586,"So to give you full context I’ll start from the beginning. My parents have been divorced since I was 3. The courts decided my Mom get custody while Sunday’s I see my Dad with grandmas supervision. According to my mother the judge wanted visitation at the police station cause he was acting super inappropriate and crazy during court (kicking/yelling and speaking on the phone when he wasn’t allowed to). Also harassing my mother at work constantly. I was too young to remember any of that, my option of my dad was formulated from my own experiences. 

At the young age of 3 I loved my dad and looked up to him since being a guy myself. As I got older I saw who he truly was. When I was 5 he was very adamant on teaching me math (which is understandable) and I complied. Anytime I didn’t understand a question, couldn’t understand a word problem, or have trouble counting backwards from 100, he would scream and yell at me, calling me names and tell me that I was retarded. Being this was a frequent thing I became scared of him and learned to endure it when he put me down. I only saw him once a week so I figured I could be strong for one day a week and not start trouble. 

He would also frequently talk bad about my mother saying how terrible she was and would say how he wished she died of cancer. 

Fast forward now I’m 11. My dad is a pretty big guy (6ft) and I was very short as a child. He wanted me to stand up against a wall so he could measure me. In fear of him I normally complied with everything he said but that day for whatever reason I said no. He kept insisting but every time, I just said no and that I’m happy with my height. This took him into a fit of rage, screaming at me from the top of his lungs, saying I’m rotten and disrespectful for not doing what he says and that I’ve been indoctrinated by my mother to not listen to him. My grandma just sat there quietly while he sent me home in tears. I told my mother I never wanted to see him anymore. When next Sunday came he pulled up in front of my house and I didn’t come out. When I didn’t he called the house a bunch of times and then called the cops. By law I was legally forced to go with him. When we got to my grandmas he sat me down and told me I wasn’t his son and that he’s not going to talk to me. I was just to sit in the other room until he called me for lunch. After about a month (4 visits) of not saying a word he decides to start talking to me again. 


Fast forward I’m 19, going through a stressful time in college. He was very pushy about me becoming a nurse, saying how great a job it is. I would have to agree, it is a good career choice. I will admit I was a slacker all throughout high school and early college and wasn’t mature enough to handle that type of workload. I’ve since straightened out. But during that time my Dad would call me a failure and tell me he wouldn’t spend any money on my education cause it be a waste (He inherited money from grandma when she died and is now rich).Constantly making remarks about my intelligence and how my mom did such a poor job. When I told him I was dropping the major he said something very passive aggressive to me over text (forgot what it was cause it’s been years). I completely lost it and just told him off. He told me to never speak to him again and said I was disowned. He sent a nasty letter to my mom and screenshot texts I sent leaving out his. 


At 21 years old he reached out to me wanting to start a relationship again. It’s almost been about a year and I just turned 22. It mainly consists of dinner and him complaining about how crazy Democrat’s are. He’ll make passive aggressive remarks when he asks me about grad school saying that I probably can’t get into any schools I named, and telling me that his sons kid is going to law school and more motivated than me. Or that I’m not allowed to be anxious because I’m young and that I didn’t experience a divorce as bad as his. Which lead him to start insulting my mom again. Saying the most vile and hateful things but following up with the statement “I don’t hate your mom she’s just evil, if I hated her I would have killed her already” 

This just made my blood boil, I had enough of his verbal abuse and told him to go fuck himself and that what he said is not ok to say(to sum it up).  I then cut off contact with him.

He told me I’m very disrespectful and he never talked to his father that way and always did what he said. Also said I won’t succeed and never get a good job. 

I genuinely think I did all that I could but according to him my mom turned me against him and I am bias. He says he did nothing wrong and never laid a finger on me or my mother. Also that I should have to listen an accept all the things he says about my mom and agree since she’s evil. Since I don’t agree I am an brainwashed, disrespectful and in the wrong to never wanna see him again."
587,my boyfriend has been super into me and super in love the past few months. all of the sudden he stopped putting in as much effort and claims he’s “too tired for a relationship” but says he still loves me and still wants to be together. he now also wants to talk to girls after making a big deal of it... thoughts?
588,"I (22F) have had an amazing, loving boyfriend (21M) for about four months now. 
To say he’s the light of my life is an understatement, he is absolutely a dream come true and I love him dearly and want to give him my absolute everything. I’m convinced I’m marrying this man. My only problem is, I always get so cripplingly insecure that he is going to find someone better than me. It comes and goes in waves but I recently lost my job and apartment so my self-esteem is at a low and I think that’s exacerbated it a lot, on top of being cheated on in every other relationship I’ve been in. I just wanna give him my fullest self because that’s what he deserves. He exudes confidence and perfection and I wanna be that amazing too, I ask him for reassurance sometimes and he always gives it to me, but I just sometimes still feel that insecurity that someone out there will just be better and he will leave. 
Sorry for the book."
589,"We matched each other off tinder a few months ago and I kept pushing her away saying I just wanted to be friends and that I needed to focus on myself. I wasn't in the right mindset for dating but she really kept pushing me and we went on the date. We both had a good time but again I wasn't in the right mindset and I ruined things with her via messages. 

I confused her by going back and forth between wanting to date her and just being friends. In the end she said she just wanted to be friends if I was down. I agreed it would be best as I got along with her and realised where I screwed up. (Yes I apologised to her multiple times for misleading her). Around a month ago I sent her some drunk texts and she just never responded so I moved on and forgot about her.

Then she liked something I posted on Facebook and I thought about her so I messaged her. The conversation just feels kind of awkward  and i'm not even sure if she wants to be friends or not because that's what most people say when they try to end things. She has been responding to me but do you think maybe it's best I just leave things here? 

I do think we got a long well and I didn't even really feel a spark in a romantic way towards her but I had fun with her."
590,"am i an idiot for asking him a little time not to leave me? ive(22) been in a relationship with this guy(22) for almost 2 years, now he wants to get out of our relationship for a selfish reason said himself, he said he wants to experience constant changes in his life and he's been too stagnant for a long time. i dont really see the problem with us, we fight and its normal i sometimes get it why he wants out but then i just cant unlove him in an instant, im still in a state where i enjoy seeing him. i mean he gets me through a lot of pain but atleast im happy when im with him, we both are. theres so many ideas coming inside my head why he had to finish what we have and its making me feel horrible. idk what to do now. i wanna free him from me but im not ready yet. u think i made the right choice or should i just let him go? gaahd this is so painful."
591,It happened again tonight. He knew I was upset and he just left for an hour. For some background I have social anxiety. We went to go get dinner and the girl working went and got the other customers order before giving him ours which was sitting on the counter. So he got really mad. Then a thing for pokemon go was up and he got mad he was going to miss it. I told him he'd live but I didn't mean anything bad by it. He stopped anyway with the food and said it was because I said that. I remarked he was taking his anger out on me because he was mad at the girl in the restaurant. He said some stuff about not stopping with my hobby. But I've never stopped in the middle of dinner or made food cold because of my hobby. If he had said things jokingly I wouldn't have been so upset but he was really angry. He has a lot of anger/blood pressure issues. Then we went home and he came inside way before me. You could tell he was mad as he rushed in before I was even out of the car with the food. He sit in the living room where we usually don't eat. I put the food in the kitchen and went to lay down in the bed room. He came in a few minutes with the food but didn't say anything to me. We usually eat on the bed and watch TV. He put headphones in and started eating. I got up to go to the bathroom. One because my stomach hurt and the other became my anxiety was so high. He then left the apartment. He came back maybe 45 minutes later. Asked me if I wanted him to leave. I hate when he does this so much. Him leaving causes me more anxiety. I just want to make up right away during a fight. I was back in the bathroom at this point and told him my stomach hurt. Then I went out and talked to him. He said he left because he didn't want more of an argument and just walked around the apartment. I'm not even good at arguments because of my anxiety.  It just feels like he runs away when he doesn't want to deal with the mess he made from his anger. He usually apologizes easily for the smallest thing but if it's something important he won't say anything at all to me and just leave for a while. Then come back and ask if I want him to leave. It hurts me so much that he would rather leave than talk to me. I can't imagine having children with someone who doesn't care about my well being and will just leave when things get bad. For the record even when he didn'tive here I would tell him not to leave. Now he lives here and STILL offers to leave. It's very upsetting.
592,"We’ve known each other since 2017. I messed up before and so has he but we’ve learned to forgive each other. We placed GOD in our lives continuously each day and we managed to get to where we are now. We spoke the other day and I saw no love in his eyes and I told him that. This was an eye opener to him, we prayed on it and spoke about it together and I know if he doesn’t love me any longer there’s nothing I can do about it. We are taking a break and focusing on ourselves right now. Someone, anyone please give me advice on how to save my relationship. I’m in love with him, and I know relationships can sometimes fall into this pit of danger, but where do I start? What do I do? How can I bring happiness back into his heart so we can save this relationship?"
593,"I’m 20, my ex is 27. The more time that passes the better I can slowly understand the situation. We were together for a year and a half.. mostly long distance. When we met each other we knew we were exactly what the other person wanted and we just went for it from day 1. We had the most wonderful trips, we went to Europe in August, our families loved each other, we spent hours on the phone talking everyday. We were pieces of each other. I wanted to marry him. I sacrificed so much for him. But 6 months into the relationship he admitted he was in love with his married ex girlfriend. Who just recently had a baby. She couldn’t speak English. I helped him through it but I always knew he had some weird thing with her. I never felt I was enough. I bent over backwards in everything we did to make him happy with the hope that maybe he would finally treat me better. From doing things sexually I wasn’t completely comfortable with to taking meds because “there was something wrong with me”. I became dependent on stimulants &amp; alcohol for a few month trying to numb the pains of the relationship. Dropped out of college. Everything I did began to piss him off.  He knew he was hurting me but wouldnt let me go. So I thought this was love. I hated myself because he wasn’t happy with me. When I would cry and beg for some sort of response, he used to record me on his phone or laugh in my face. I was desperate. Finally last week I had a very strange panic attack that he triggered. He kept ignoring me and being passive completely out of the blue.. I told him to stop and I wasn’t feeling well but he kept going. I began to hyperventilate, my hands locked up and fingertips turned blue, i was dizzy and couldn’t breathe it felt like. We both were terrified, He calmed me down... but about an hour later he did it all over again. I told him stop, it’s going to happen again, and he didn’t care. So I ended up having two panic attacks like that in one day. And.. I still forgave him for all of it and said “he needs to learn..” but he didn’t. He didn’t care. He just didn’t want to deal with me. And these are just 2/100 bad things he’s done to me. One includes him threatening to lock me in a hotel room by myself in some ghost town. But that’s a long story. Anyways I haven’t talked to him in a week. Hopefully I can be strong and never unblock his number again. I always go back. He knows this. I wonder why he didn’t want to be nice to me. I still believe he loves me. And im scared when he comes to find me I will believe every word he says and take him back. But I think this must be some form of narcissism?  Maybe I am just co dependent. I don’t know how this works."
594,"this is more of me asking for advice on how i should think about certain experiences in my past relationships. for the record, i'm now happier and in a different relationship with someone who fully respects me, my body, and my morals. 

**((possible sexual assault tw))**

i thought i was in love with the guy i lost my virginity to (i was 17, he was 18 and we were together for a full year) but looking back on it now it was a very toxic relationship. this included him yelling at me, gaslighting, complaining about how expensive i was even though i never asked him to pay for anything for me, refusing to go on dates because he was broke yet somehow could afford to blow a lot of money on weed every week, making a tinder behind my back for a reason i'm still not aware of, etc. i realize that sexually it was pretty toxic as well. nearly every time we fucked we were either drunk or high, and sex and weed was basically the only thing holding us together. looking back on it now, a lot of the things he did to me make me extremely uncomfortable but i don't know how to classify my experiences, so to speak.

we can start with him just straight up refusing to wear condoms. i had an iud and at the time we were both virgins so it didn't seem like a huge deal, but now i feel like i was completely violated. he had a lot of trouble getting it up at the beginning which he accredited to the condoms being uncomfortable, so i reluctantly agreed to not use them. after this, he would either finish on me or inside of me, neither of which i remember giving him permission to do nor him asking for it in the first place. i didn't say anything at the time because my moral judgement was pretty clouded, but thinking about it now just makes me feel so uncomfortable and disrespected. 

sex was pretty consistent after that, but he would do things again without asking; choking, slapping, putting his finger in a place that many consider to be an ""exit only."" i would say ow or try to move his hands away if i didn't like what he was doing, but i think he just ignored me. sex with him hurt more than it felt good, and usually once he finished it was over. he didn't care about my pleasure which i know is pretty typical but it also doesn't seem like he really cared about how he was treating my body or how i thought about it. i'm not sure if i should consider this sexual abuse or what, but even thinking about it all just makes me feel like crying. i just feel so violated now even though i didn't really think too much at the time (granted i was usually high so i had very cloudy judgement anyways).

after i broke up with him 7 months ago, i sort of got back with a different ex (18m) who, big surprise, got me high one night, started making out with me, then took my shirt off and sucked on my chest. it was really uncomfortable and hurt quite a bit so i stopped him after a while but he didn't ask me if he could do it in the first place. again, i feel worse about it looking back now than i did while it was happening. thankfully i didn't let him get any further despite him constantly talking about it.

i'm in a much healthier relationship now - the guy i'm with is very respectful of my body, always asks what's okay and communicates with me which means so much to me. i do get really uncomfy talking about my past sexual experiences with him though because i just feel embarrassed to admit that i let that stuff happen to me. 

i don't know if i should seek help about this..? it feels almost like trauma or sexual assault or something like that but it doesn't seem extreme enough for me to classify it as such because some people have experiences that are so much worse. i just get really uncomfortable now and thinking about what i let those gross guys do to me makes me upset. i feel like my body didn't really belong to me.

any advice on how i should recover from and classify these experiences? it's too complicated for me to figure out on my own."
595,"To preface, I’m 18m, and this situation involves two girls, D and B. We all work at the same store.

D and I dated for about 6 months and actually just broke up last week. We started working at the same time 2 months ago. D and I are currently taking some space, I’m not sure if I want a friendship with her after the dynamics of our breakup.

Either way, B just started last week. D and B have talked a little, I haven’t seen enough of their interaction to gauge if they’re friends or not. B and i have got along from meeting, we are majoring in the same thing and share a lot of common interests.

She kept saying we should hangout soon, so I took this is a hint to ask for her number. We exchanged numbers and I asked her if she wanted to go to the mall with me on Friday. She said yes and added in that we should get dinner. (This was all after D and I broke up)

First of all, D was my first girlfriend so I’m inexperienced, is this a date? Do I offer to pay for dinner? 

Second of all, do I tell B I used to date D this soon? If so when and how? Should I shoot her a text a couple hours before picking her up or should I just not bring it up yet and see how this hang out/date time goes?

Also, D does not know. If she did, all jealous hell would break loose I’m sure

Thanks for any advice"
596,"My (17F) boyfriend (17M) are seniors in high school. We used to do everything together and have lots of physical contact but he has always been a gentleman about everything: never pushing for anything sexual, opening doors, making sure I get everywhere safely, etc. but lately he has completely pulled back. Now he won’t hold even my hand and I’ll be lucky if I get a quick kiss between classes. He often still opens doors for me but it now seems like he’s annoyed to do it and only does it out of obligation. He’ll get annoyed about something and suddenly he just turns completely cold to me and it’s like he isn’t interested in talking to me or even being around me. We always used to joke around together but now if I make a joke to lighten the mood, he’ll basically just tell me that my joke is dumb and outdated. Then one of his friends will tell almost the same joke and it’ll be hilarious to him. He and his friends love acting like they’re attracted to each other and his friends’ girlfriends and I all find it hilarious especially because we all know that they’re just messing around. Anymore though, I’m starting to feel jealous of his friends. I was one of them and we would all mess around but now that he and I are going out, it’s like I don’t count as one of them anymore. I get the feeling that our friends (who are all straight guys) are just keeping a bit more distance to respect our relationship and not give my boyfriend any reason to worry but my boyfriend acts like he barely tolerates me or like he only tolerated me when he’s in the mood. I began asking him for permission as a joking way of saying “because we never do that anymore” I would even ask him if I could hold his hand. He said that I didn’t need permission but I don’t want to force him into anything. I don’t want to feel jealous but I feel like I’ve kinda just been tossed aside. Today he touched his friend’s ass more than he touched me at all. And he got annoyed at me over something that happened in class. Am I being overly sensitive or is there something wrong? Is he just not attracted to me anymore? Is this just a basic case of the whole “being on good behavior for the first couple of months and then returning to yourself” thing? Or is there possibly something going on with him that I need to talk to him about?"
597,my friend just got dumped out of the blue today and i am heading over there after my evening class. i am just curious on any ideas for nice gestures i could do to help her through it or anything i could tell her to take some of the weight off. what’s the best thing someone has done for you after a break up ? i really wanna help her out because i know id need a friend if i were in her shoes.
598,"I have been with my boyfriend for 10 years and we are both in our mid-late 20's. I am getting mixed signals from him and I don't know what to do or how to take these signals.

I want to get engaged and married and have been upfront about that from the start. Obviously we started dating quite young, so I wasn't in a rush until about 2 years ago. I told him that I wanted to be engaged by the end of this year or else I'm done and need to find someone who wants the same things as me. 

All of my friends are engaged or married, and most of his are. Another one of our friends got engaged last month and he asked if it made me mad that we aren't engaged yet. I told him that at this point I didn't think it was going to happen for us, but I was happy for our friends. He told me he has been thinking about it more recently, which gave me some false hope. He also told me he would like to go and try on rings with me and also book a venue date so we know it will for sure happen. 

This is all great but he seems uninterested in moving forward with what he said to me. I asked to try on rings and he said he doesn't want to because it will be a long process going to the jeweler, doing the education, trying on rings, etc. I also have brought up multiple venues we can book and he always finds something wrong with them so we don't do it. Why did he suggest it and then not want to do it?

He has very much withdrawn since stating what he said. Every morning, he sleeps in while I get up for work, he's still sleeping when I am driving to work, and when I get home the place is a mess because he slept in and left stuff out when making his lunch and getting ready for the day. When I come home for the day, I make supper, or else we don't eat, and he sits on the couch on twitter. I then clean up and go watch Netflix in the room by myself while he is still on twitter. I go to bed and he sits on the living room on twitter. I feel like I have no connection to him anymore. His life is sleeping and Twitter. He only talks about himself, his day, and his interests and shows no interest in mine. I don't know what to do! All signs are saying that he has checked out and wants to push me away, but then he says he wants to marry me and we should book a venue to make sure of it. I don't know what to do and it's driving me crazy! I feel like we are going no where and I don't know how much longer to wait it out. Please help...


TLDR;: boyfriend of 10 years shows no interest in me but then says he wants to get married."
599,"  Hi. I am a 19 year old, female college student who lives in a house with 5 other 19-20 year old girls. We all get along pretty well, but we have petty arguments / inter-house drama. We all work and go to school so we dont see each other as often as we used to.
  
Okay here is my problem. My roommate Dolores [19] has let her boyfriend, Igor [21] stay at our house for two months. Two whole months. Without asking anyone if it was okay. At first i didnt mind, but now i do. i want to be able to feel comfortable in my house. like he is always here. he doesnt have a job, a car... he does go out with his friends a lot but he still just stays here often playing video games loudly into the night. This month we went over our wifi bill so i have been using my data. You know who used 40% of our wifi? Igor. You know who doesnt pay the wifi? Igor. Also our landlord asked us about our water bill being higher than normal. So...


 The five of us roommates, excluding Dolores, talked about asking her to have Igor leave. We all agreed and decided to have a house meeting. I explained to Dolores my frustrations because I need the wifi for school, my personal data bill, plus i have to pay for an overage now (that i didnt cause because im not even home that often! none of us are, he just is ... all day. playing xbox). Other roommates said they agreed etc. Dolores seemed to be understanding and said he would be gone by the weekend. That night he texted our house groupchat off Dolores phone. He said he would pay for the half of the people who lives below us bill? Like that helps?? Idk so weird but he said he was leaving. Hallelujah!!! Right?? No . Im wrong
 

 Yesterday my roommates and I noticed he was still here. After he was supposed to be gone, so my one roommate Stephanie [19] texted my other two roommate Grapefruit [20] and Ashely[19].  Stephanie had texted: Why is Igor still here? , Ashely , then said something back and sent a screenshot to Dolores. So like I guess some of my roommates are cool with hin staying now? Anyway Dolores texted Stephanie rudely, saying that her boyfriend and her “spilt the stuff: paper towels, toilet paper, water” and that he could stay. LIKE WTF. It is Wednesday night, he is still here. What do i even do?"
600,"So I’ve been with this guy for almost 3 years, doesn’t sound much of a time but after reading somewhere on the wild web, the average relationship only lasts 3 years, crazy right? And that’s how long he was with his ex for 🤷🏻‍♀️ they got two kids out of it. Anyway that’s besides the point...

He gets up goes to work, comes home has his tea then goes to bed! He’s too tired to spend time with me oh and did I not mention he has his friend staying here which went from weekends as he worked away Monday to Friday to now mid week too as he’s now working local!As I was saying he’s too tried to spend anytime with me especially while his mates here he just plays on the ps4 which I add he bought me 💁🏻‍♀️ obviously so he would benefit 🙄 these past 4/5 nights I’ve been going to bed by myself which may sound odd but it’s never been like that unless he’s on nights, when he comes to bed we don’t cuddle anymore we don’t have sex as often maybe like once a week! I feel like I’m out growing him. I love him to bits but he’s so fucking blind, I’ve told him how I feel I’ve even broke up with him to try make him understand I don’t want to be showered with gifts and I know he’s busy at work I just want some time wether it’s the time he spends with his friend instead of me or wether it’s cooking tea together if he’s home, laying in bed together just talking showing an interest in each other’s lives for 5 minutes! That’s another thing when I text him half the time the message doesn’t even get read never mind a reply! I just feel like I’m worthless and he isn’t interested anymore! I don’t know that the hell to do! My emotions are all over one minute I’m crying and I don’t cry easily him seeing me cry does nothing anymore as I’m always crying at the moment, or I’m so angry and mad I’m throwing it all away asking him why I’m not good enough why he doesn’t have time for me or when he does have time he doesn’t spend it with me, he says im ‘too needy’ we’ve been living together nearly 2 years am I that boring he’s rather sit on a game console at 26years old then stand and have a conversation with his girlfriend why she’s making his pack up for work the next day or washing the dishes. 

I just feel so drained..."
601,"I (20F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been dating for almost 2 years. I have struggled with Anxiety since I was little. This man is so wonderful. He does everything right and we are so good together but then my anxiety ruins it and i overthink way too much. I always think hes going to leave me. I hate that i feel this way sometimes and have urges to mention it because he constantly tells me thats not the case and hes never leaving. I hate doing this to him. He works his ass off to make me happy and he does. But my anxiety gets the best of me. I want to stop being this way because I fear one day it will really push him over the edge. We will be having such a good day and I latch onto the most irrational things. We always joke if we go a week without fighting than its a good week, and i hate that because i know its unhealthy and If i didnt do all of this irrational thinking we probably would rarely fight. Hes such an amazing guy I really dont want to let him slip away. How do I stop feeling this way? And what can i do to show him I've stopped this behavior?"
602,I’ve been crushing hard on one of my coworkers and I don’t know how to get the ball rolling. We’re both college students so our jobs aren’t serious to the point that I feel it’s a bad idea to go after him. He seems shy but he’s friendly and I’m just wondering how to make it apparent that I’m interested? We haven’t hung out outside of work and I’m trying g to figure out how to go about making that happen. Any ideas?
603,"I can't make friends if I wished to, due to a lack of social skills. I can't tell who to talk to or when, and I don't know how to figure that out in a causal environment. I also don't know how to even find clubs or activities in my community, as the subreddits and meetups from meetup.com are in my country are pretty much completely dead. 

I honeslty don't know ow to learn any of this, or how to find and activity even for something that interests me. I feel stupid for not knowing how to find ways meet people when everyone else seems to know how. I cant even socialise on discord.

What the best way forward or the best way out for me?"
604,"So I (19M) caught feelings for my close friend (18F) and turns out she had had a crush on me for years. We hung out constantly for weeks and she promised once she sorted out some familly issues she would be ready for a relationship.

She went through some tough times and completely blanked me for like 10 days. Then yesterday she texted me saying she was getting to know someone and they were dating now. I was fucking heartbroken ngl I really like her and I thought she felt the same.

I had to just put down my phone for the day and now she's mad that she's ""gonna lose me because of this"". I'm 50/50 between being hurt and not wanting to talk to her and also still feeling attracted to her. Both of those make it really hard to go back to being friends. What do I do?"
605,Pretty self explanatory. It’s driving me nuts and I’m not the confrontational type. It’s a noise that I have the pleasure of falling asleep to just about every night.
606,"Hey Gang,

My wife is experience overwhelming babyblues after birthing our brand new beautiful baby daughter and has been passing me some hints/vibes that she's looking for a nice evening to spend one on one time together snuggling and stuff.

My question is can I get some advice on last minute romantic ideas for a date tonight? Something like a take home picnic or casual lounging date ideas, but I'm horribly uncreative rn.

Thanks in advance!"
607,"I started going on dates with a girl who was my friend about 2 months ago. She had just gotten out of a serious relationship a month before that. We recently had sex, and she told me she wants to date me but isn't mentally ready yet. She also told me shes deleted dating apps, and has stopped talking to other guys cause nothing was close to what we have. 

So normally I would think we were starting to get close to me asking her to be my girlfriend, but we got drunk one night and were asking each other flirty questions and she revealed she still thinks about her ex, and how a guy who she had talked to before randomly texted her and how she really wanted to see if anything was there. That's why she hasn't felt mentally ready to date me cause she doesn't wanna go into it if shes not 100% sure. The next day she was sorry for telling me her thoughts but said they were real feelings she has. Ever since then things have slowed down between us and shes been more distant. Still talking and saying she misses me and I make her happy. But not flirty, or trying as hard to see me.

I obviously understand were only dating and not exclusive but I'm unsure of what to do from here. I told her we weren't together so she could do whatever she wanted to do, but that I cared for her and thought it would be a mistake to give up what we have. This whole ordeal has made me realize how much I care for her, but unsure if I should tough it out, or if I should start going back out with other people and working away from her. Any advice on what I should do from here or questions y'all have will be greatly appreciated.

TLDR- Girl I've been dating for 2 months reveals she has feelings still for ex, and is interested in another guy. After telling me she was done with dating apps and other guys."
608,"So a little back story about the bully, we’ll call him K (first letter of his name). K used to bully me for almost 3 years, I used to(still kinda am) bigger than most, during the time he bullied me I was a fat nonathletic POS, then my freshman year I took up lifting and went through a growth spurt, I went form a 5’ 10” 270 chubby loser to an 6’ 255 decent athlete, lineman, wrestle, and thrower. He stated the year off and I beat the shit out of him on the first day, about a week later he moved form the shit his class gave him form getting his ass kicked by a freshman. So he goes to a different school. 

Fast forward about 2 year to now my junior year, I’m 6’ 2 and 255, most of me is muscle expect my main body and a little bit of my arms, still some fat.” I’m arguably one of the strongest kids in our school, a very small school.” However I have slight social anxiety and get really nervous doing important stuff, which makes asking this girl I like we’ll call her Abby, (not her real name) she is an old friend, we don’t talk much but when we are in the same class we talk a decent amount, about two weeks ago my buddy, he is her best friend as well, told me that K is trying to chat her up. I’m a little pissed hearing that name cuz I haven’t herd it in a minute, however I think nothing of it. Until last Friday rolls around, it’s a big game, I played like a German panzer making a shit load of tackles and a few sacks. I got a text on that Saturday form my friend, “hey bro did you sleep with P?,” now fun fact about P she was one of Madison friends, until she backstabbed her and got herself expelled form bringing a water bottle full of weed to school(idiot) my friend told me K is making rumors about me or get Abby to not like me and date him. WTF do I do? I wanna put this smug wanna be hockey player in his place like I did freshman year."
609,"My [26/m] parents usually does the angry approach when disciplining my siblings [they are 14 and 12]. 
Their method teaching them how to do things in the house feels like it's lacking. I feel like there is a need of parental guidance. They would just tell the kids what to do then move on with their day; and if the kids forget it and nothing is done, my parents would get mad, do it themselves or give them a long lecture. There's no teaching in between, there's no parental presence. Just to clarify, my siblings are not angels, they are good kids but they're lazy that is why they need discipline and guidance. Which leads to my concern.


Yesterday, mom and dad spoke to me about this issue. Dad says he hates lecturing them because the kids might start seeing him as an angry person; mom says she feels disrespected cause the kids don't listen to her. They are worried that the kids are getting distant. I told them, since dad needs a break from being the authoritative figure and mom needs it, why don't they try switching roles? I also told them that maybe the kids just need some bonding time with them like teaching them how to clean their room properly. That way they spend time bonding together and they learn how to do their chores the easy and right way. They told me that it won't work and I need to be the team leader and be the one teaching them how to do stuff in the house. I told them I have no problem with teaching the kids, but it doesn't fix the fact that the kids need bonding time with them. Plus the kids don't complain about the chores, the reason why they don't do it is either they forget cause they are distracted by friends and videogames, or they stop because they don't know how to do it properly. They still disagreed.


They told me I am wrong, that telling them what to do should be enough and they need to have the initiative to help out in the first place. Then they tell me that the kids listen to me so I should be the one to discipline them... I just couldn't talk at that point. I wanted to ask them why they don't see that as a problem. Like, hello? Your kids don't listen to you. Why do I have to be the parent instead of you guys changing your methods and improving your relationship? I wanted to tell them that it's their responsibility as a parent but I'm pretty sure they will just hit me back with ""You're the older brother, you have to be responsible for them too.""


I just don't know what to do at this point. It seems like they just want to get rid of the ""chores problem"" instead of bettering their relationship with their kids. I'm married and I have a life to grow. All I can do is teach and remind my sibs like my parents wants me to, but I will not always be there."
610,"How can I train myself to be a better initiator/leader in a relationship when I am not naturally good at it?

My (26 M) fiancee Sarah (22 F) has anxiety. She can try and try hard at times, but it's hard and I get that.  

She's communicated she wants me to ""lead in the relationship"" and make the majority of decisions in regards to plans that she finds stressful (especially social situations) or like what we should do or where we should go on date night so she can enjoy herself more (I've noticed she really does the times I can pull something together.)

Thing is, my skills at being a social/relationship leader are meh, more career leading so I am not naturally good at it. Tips or stories of how you went from 0 to hero too? 

Examples: If we go out to a bar and she's bored, I don't really know what to do for a backup so late or if it's a work/school night what to do besides stay in or do the same 2-3 things. Looking to think better on my feet"
611," 

TL;DR I helped her cheat with her ex, she cheated on me, who could of seen that coming?


Where do I begin...our relationship started with her cheating on her ex with me. (I know that was stupid) According to her they were broken up (she was sleeping on the couch, they stopped having sex). But she didn't tell him she was leaving until after we had messed around. Our relationship starting this way planted doubt in my mind about trusting her since day one, it gradually got worse but was always there. Skip forward almost 2 years now. Maybe a month ago I tell her I feel like she would cheat on me given the chance. Before this she was great, she had never done anything to hurt me and I still wonder if telling her that was unfair because I willingly cheated with her, Im at fault too. I'll just refer to this as the 'incident'. Ever since then its been different. I ask her whats up, she tells me what I told her crushed her and broke her heart, shes fallen out of love with me and doesn't know if she will ever have the same feelings for me again, but shes open to a 'fresh start' to try and get the feelings back (after convincing her to try).


Same deal. Something just wasn't right. A week or two goes by, I tell her I still feel like shes different. She hits me with ""I feel like I cant talk to you, you don't validate my feelings."" Look, I know this is text and all and you cant know my personality. But I was constantly asking her to talk to me, to open up and that I was willing to try and mend what I said and work towards what our old relationship was. Well this was the final fight, I told her that was BS, I'm always trying to get to to talk to me. She brought up me not letting her get a cat (no seriously) as part of the reason she fell out of love with me. I said ""thats ridiculous"" and this leads to ""see, you dont validate my feelings I cant talk to you, im leaving for the night"". I all but beg her not to go, I tell her ""just talk to me, PLEASE"" no dice, she leaves. She eventually comes back late at night and lies to me about where she was. At this point im still in ""Im sorry you feel like I dont listen to you, I can work on it, we can fix this"" mode. All im getting is ""I dont think this will work"". This goes on for the rest of the night and into the next morning, shes flat out said she that the relationship isnt working and we were breaking up. More boohooing from me and ""why is it unfixable? Why would you talk to me?"" She finally tells me shes been emotionally cheating on me with a guy from work. She loves how he comforts her and can talk to him and how he holds her. They meet after I leave for work but she stresses it was never physical cheating. They've been talking for weeks (he said months) and he loves her. aint that some shit. She met him the day before when she left for the night. I'm rambling but she hid this pretty well, she deliberately hid this relationship multiple ways including deleted their texts and never saving his number under a name. Now that shes told me shes crying, "" IM SO SORRY, I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU ABOUT HIM, I NEVER WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN, I WILL STOP TALKING TO HIM, WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK, I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE""


Honestly, once she told me all of this we both did a 180 on emotions. From me there was no more boohooing. She immediately went hysterical compared to almost total apathy earlier. We both made it very clear at the start our relationship started out with cheating on her ex but it wouldnt be tolerated in ours. (Lol am I an idiot or what) FUN FACT. in that same conversation she herself brought up emotional cheating and how SHE qualified it as bad as physical cheating. I know this relationship is over. She was right because this is unfixable.


Was this my fault? I mean what did I expect? I feel like I deserve this and its payback for what I did to her ex. I knew what I was doing and I did it anyways. The worst part to me is that I still have feelings for her. God it would be nice to just close my eyes, pretend this didnt happen and be able to hold her like I used to. But I have enough self respect for myself to realize thats totally unrealistic and pathetic. How can I deal with this?"
612,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost a year, our 1 year anniversary coming up in a couple weeks. She is nice and sweet and really cares about me unlike my last relationship. What drew me towards her was her smile. So I asked her out and we really hit things off. Months go by and all is well but there's something just off. 

This is the first time I've ever felt like the girl I was dating had a higher sex drive than I, but the more I thought about it the more I started to realize that the problem is that I'm not sexually attracted to her. She will often change in front of me and I don't even have the urge to look, or sometimes she lays in bed with me literally naked and it feels like a chore because I'm just not feeling it. I feel bad because I can tell this bothers her and she has started to subtly say things about how I'm not attracted to her. 

She is an incredible person and so nice, but I'm starting to feel like we are on different wavelengths in terms of where we are in the relationship and I don't know how to talk to her about it. She talks about moving in together and having kids and this idea scares me to be totally honest. I genuinely enjoy spending time with her but I feel this strange frustration when she will touch me or kiss me in a certain way because most of the time I just don't want to do it with her, and that's not fair to her. But it's creating this tension on the relationship at least for me that I need to deal with. 

I guess the advice I'm seeking is, is it time for me to end it? Am I an asshole for ending a relationship with someone due to something as trivial as sex? People often say looks fade and I realize this, but what relationship can be successful when you dread being touched in a sexual way because then you have to pretend to be interested in order to not hurt the other person? 

Any feedback is appreciated. 

(Also forgot to mention that we are going on a trip for our 1 year anniversary, and in my head this event has been like a finish line for me in a sense. After we do that there's nothing planned for us and it would be the easiest time to let it go.)"
613,"This is a throwaway account.

We've been dating for a little over a year, though we haven't actually gone on many real dates and that's an issue we discussed recently and figured out a plan for just this past Monday. I am a senior in high school and she graduated last year. I started the year off really rough and some personal mental problems caused me to fall really far behind in my work. In trying to balance catching up, college apps, as well as my job, I haven't been able to spend as much time with her as we both want to. I am getting more on top of things as I regain my mental health and part of what we talked about on Monday is how we'll be able to spend more quality time together and break the feeling of routine that has pervaded as of late, and now that I'm closer to being caught up it's something that is more achievable. In addition to that, I have been sick for the past three days and pretty much bedridden, and we haven't had sex in about a week. Now is also not a good time because my sister (who lives on the other side of the country) is visiting and will only be here today and tomorrow. As a recent theme unfortunately, I have become a bit unreliable because of how much I am trying to juggle, and she has begun to feel lonely within our relationship. She's telling me she wants sex, and I feel like I cannot provide right now because I feel physically awful and tomorrow is the only real chance I have to spend time with my sister before she leaves, and when I told her that she got very angry with me. I also accidentally stood her up yesterday because I worded something poorly and she interpreted it as me saying I would come over for sex that afternoon when in reality I meant that I was going to try to feel better by the next day or the day after the next, and she got really mad at me for that. I understand her side because it's just another instance where I am unavailable and giving excuses, but this time I just feel like I got fucked over by a poorly timed illness and it might be a little unfair the way she's getting angry at me for it, though I can't tell if that's also just me being selfish because I haven't really been satisfying her needs as a partner lately. I really love her and am trying my hardest to get my life back on track so I can be what I want to be for her and myself. I've let a lot of external things get in the way of me basically having a social life and being a loving partner to her, but all I keep doing is telling her that I'm trying and I understand that after a while it just becomes noise. I guess I really just need help understanding how to interpret this situation and need some advice as to what to do moving forward, because I really don't feel like this is healthy for our relationship or for my mental health."
614,"It's been going on for about a month now where whenever we start to kiss or anything, he falls asleep. I could wake him up 100x and he'd still nod off, no matter how hard i try to keep his attention. He also falls asleep when we go out on dates. 

I've told him that i feel like he's losing interest in me and he tells me that's not the case. A few weeks ago he told he he'd try not to but He'll initiate and still fall asleep. I'm getting frustrated and don't know how long I should let this keep going on. 

Any help is appreciated."
615,"One day, my friend and I were talking and we found out we're both into the same girl. Since then, he's being an ass about it, saying things like ""back the fuck off or i'll beat the shit out of you"", just overall bein a real stand up dude. Thing is, all he's done so far is have lunch with her once (over a period of 3 weeks since this started), it's not like they're bumpin uglies. She has told me that she doesn't like him at all (she volunteered the information, I didn't bring it up), and I'm really not sure how to go about this without ruining my friendship with the dude, while still being able to make a move on the girl. I've considered telling him about what she told me, but there's a good chance he doesn't believe me, or worse, tells her I spilled the beans, which might make her not trust me anymore. Any help is GREATLY appreciated. 
Thanks!"

My boyfriend has a digestive sickness (I don’t remember the name), it makes him feel nauseous, get cramps, and just overall makes life harder for him. He’s on medication to gain weight, which will over time solve this issue, but for now waves of feeling horrible come over him pretty unpredictably. When he does feel sick, he basically has to wait it out, lie down or sleep until it passes. 
So, sometimes he starts to feel sick when we’re hanging out, and I have to go home early or leave early. Or some other times he wakes up on the day we have plans not feeling well, and then we don’t end up hanging out. 
I’m not mad at him when this happens, it just makes me really stressed out and sad. It’s hard to cope with some days. I don’t doubt that he’s being truthful, our relationship is healthy and I trust him. I love being with him and we have fun together, but this problem weighs heavily on our relationship, at least on my part. 
I don’t want to break up with him, but I’m wondering what kind of techniques you guys have that could maybe make this easier for me? Or any advice in general. Thank you so much."
617,"My brother is the type of person who really only cares to talk to you if you are of use to him. A lot of our family members have cut him off because of this. 

I don’t really take shit like this, but for some reason I have a soft spot for my brother. He’s an asshole to pretty much everyone and is always fucking people over, but I’m always willing to help him whenever he needs it even though most of his problems are brought upon him by himself. 

Yesterday was my birthday and he didn’t say happy birthday to me because he was upset that we invited him last minute to a small get together at my moms house, even though it was completely planned last minute. This especially hurt because I was the only one who would take him in a few weeks ago when his wife kicked him out, even though he hadn’t talked to me for months up until that point. I didn’t really care about this because it’s not unusual for him anyway, it was either take him in or let him sleep in has car which I am just unable to do. 

Anyway, I’ve gotten to the point where I’m just kind of over his shit. But my brother is the type of person that if you don’t agree to help him for whatever reason, you’re suddenly the bad guy and he wants nothing to do with you. I don’t care about having a relationship with him, I’m used to him coming in and out of my life. But it would really hurt me if he took his anger out on my by not letting me see my niece and nephew. Being cordial is not an option, if he ever asks for help from me and I don’t comply, it’s completely game over. 

Any advice??"
618,"Context is important for this but it's fairly complicated so I'll try to keep it brief as possible. Me and my GF have been dating for 8 months. It was really the first healthy relationship I've had as the other two longish term relationships I've been in were on one hand extremely emotionally abusive, or on the other very distant and unavailable, both ended with them cheating on me. I graduated High School last spring and am now in trade school to be an electrician (8am-1245pm) and work everyday(1pm-7pm), and I still live at my parents. My girlfriend is a senior and also works quite a bit but she only has like 3 classes a day. 

Now for the complicated part that I am simplifying so you don't have to read anymore of a text wall: Over the summer, her father, who is very abusive, kicked her out, and my parents had her move in with us. At first, things were great. I had recently climbed out of depression and addiction, she was doing a lot better living in a stable house rather than with her father, we both felt like we had finally found someone healthy for us to be with.

I'm not sure if I feel that way anymore. I used to go out with my friends all the time even when i was in school and working two jobs, and i rarely see them at all anymore. We're both stressed out but when I get really stressed out I need to be left alone for awhile, but she copes with her stress by being with me. Whenever I tell her I need space or would rather hang out with my friends that night she gets really upset and passive aggressive and i feel like shit for it. She has a lot of emotional issues and is very self conscious and will say really bad things about herself a lot and I try my best to make her feel better but it never seems to work and just adds to my stress and I'm starting to resent her.

All of what I'm about to say makes me feel like a really shitty person but I can't help the fact that I feel this way. The lack of space on top of the stress and feeling like I'm responsible for her mental health as well as keeping mine in the first genuinely good space its been in since I was 12 makes me just want to run from this as fast as I can, but I can't. It's getting so bad that at this point most the time hearing her talk like irritates me, I never outwardly like express it to her though because I don't want to hurt her. I feel like she complains too much about school and her job, I rarely complain about work or school even though my school load is a lot more intense and I work more hours a week. It even goes over to our sex life and now 99% of the time i would honestly rather just jerk off. This is a big simplification of how I'm feeling but i feel so goddamn overwhelmed, being around her now just makes me fucking stressed out and a lot of times i just dread picking her up from work or coming home and her being here.

I feel like a relationship with someone I live with on top of my school and work is too much to deal with, and at this point I believe I want to break up, but I have literally no clue how to go about that. The only kinds of relationships I've broken off have been really easy to do so because we either just went on one or two dates or they cheated on me so I was pissed, I am so lost as to what to do now. I still love her but I just dont think I can do this right now, but then I feel trapped because what the fuck do we do from there? Does she sleep on the couch and we're exes but both still live together? I don't want her to have to go back to her dad's. And then on top of that I have very legitimate reason to believe that if I broke up with her she might become suicidal, and all of this just makes me feel so much more trapped and want to run the fuck away even more. What should I do from here?

TLDR: GFs abusive dad kicked her out so she lives with me and my parents, I feel like it is too much stress right now and that my mental health is at risk, but dont know what to do because she can't afford to live on her own, her dad is abusive, and feel like she might try to kill herself if i broke up with her."
619,"We are both in college. Hes a 2nd year while I am a first year. I am getting a bachelor's in biology and he in computer science. Now that major is very hard, but the stress school causes my boyfriend currently effects our relationship in the fact he is often in a down mood or frustrated, he is rarely in the lovey dovey mood anymore because he is too stressed. And it's only going to get worse. 

We just registered for spring 2020 classes. We are both taking 15 credits but I scheduled my classes so I'm taking two sciences with labs in person and two online classed. This was mainly so I could work and in general have more free time. He however is taking six classes because three of his classes are only one credit while most of mine are 4 (ie, take more classes to get to 15 credits). Two of his classes only last the first five weeks, but even after they are over he says it is way worse then his current year. 

While I was helping him with registering for classes it was awful. He kept cursing, complaining, putting his head in his hands, and at one point slammed his fist into the table hard out of anger. It's sometimes scary/worrisome when he gets like this. He then basically broke down for five minutes because he still had study for a quiz after registering. 

I love him, but it's so hard to feel like we are in a relationship sometimes when it's mostly just me coming over at night, we might have sex, watch tv or a movie, and go to bed. Rarely any cuddling or makeout sessions anymore, he's too stressed or not enough time. I love going out, doing new things together, etc but we never do anymore. 

I cant blame him, hes in a stressful major with a ton of work. But at the same time, it feels like I'm always giving more then I'm receiving currently, and its probably gona get worse in the spring.  I love him and I treasure how our relationship is when he isnt loaded with coursework, but we both have a decent amount of college left to go so coursework will be apart of our lives.

I need advice on how to approach this subject with him VERY carefully. Hes already under so much stress I feel like itd be awful of me to put relationship stress on him too. I dont know what to do.."
620,"
So I’ve been with this girl for almost two years now.
We decided to date just a couple of days after we met. 
She, about four months later, confessed me that the day after we started to date she went to her ex’s house (we live in a small city and people meeting in their houses it’s pretty common), she told me this crying, i think it came out because she couldn’t handle not telling me and she said she was afraid of me leaving her if she told me before, the thing is that she swore to me that she didn’t kiss the guy (she was still a virgin when i met her) although he tried a couple times (cause they dated, broke up but then they kept seeing each other from time to time and then for like a month stopped, thats when i appeared).

She told me she didn’t kiss him, that I’m really her first true love, that she had lost interest in him when she met me, told me that she went there so things with him could end up well, as friends, that he tried to kiss her because she didn’t told him about me (she is very insecure and didn’t want to make him angry, i really believe this cause i know how she when she is anxious), at least thats her version, after that, no contact at all, she said that when she went home he asked her why didn’t she kiss him, and THERE, FINALLY, she gathered the forces to tell him what was going on and after that he disappeared, seems like he wasn’t looking for a friend.

So that’s my story, very poorly redacted i imagine but english is not my native language so all i can say is that im sorry. 

Why did i wrote this? Because this year i started to have some anxiety issues and all this thoughts about her maybe kissing him that day and going there for that last kiss started to haunt me, i talk with her sometimes about this topic and she really conforts me but i can’t take this out of my system, i just wanna hear your opinions about all this guys, how do you feel about it?
Thanks for letting me share and for reading."
621,"I (19m) have been with my girlfriend (19f) for almost 4 years now. We went to high school together, now she's going to school and I'm working full time. Things have been mostly great for the majority of our relationship, aside from a few little rough patches here and there. My problem first started to pop up about a month ago when a new girl (19f) started working at the same hotel as me. We hit it off great, almost instantly becoming really close friends, I give her rides to and from work, we bring eachother food if one of us leaves on break, etc. Over the last few weeks I've noticed my feelings towards her starting to become more romantic as we start spending more time together. I've never expressed this to her but I get the feeling she's picked up on it and has kinda been dropping hints that she has some feelings towards me as well. I'm relatively happy with my girlfriend and the thought of leaving her is devastating, we have plans to get a place together when my current lease runs out, we're both very invested in each others families, it just seems like way too much to give up just on a gamble that I might find something better. So what should I do?"
622,I have been in some very deep relationships but I can’t seem to hold onto the ones that I really want. I have high expectations of myself and it kinda puts me into a hole when I don’t meet them. And because I have such high standards I have the same for the people I’m with. Am I wrong for keeping my standards and not settling? Or am I being too not picky and need to settle a little?
623,"My ex and I have been ‘broken up’ for about One and a half months now. We dated for about 8 months this time. I use ‘ ‘ because we didn’t actually have a discussion about ending the relationship (details below)

We use to date in high school but I ended up going to college and he was in a band that went on tour so we ended up parting ways.

15 years later and we reconnected. We still had that spark we always did, when we look at each other it just seems everyone else disappears.

However he ended up moving in with me, and issues became apparent. We worked opposite shifts, he can be kinda lazy and he has a crazy drug addict baby mama(33F).
He is also bad with money and is kind of a flake in terms of time management, he’s always late for work and appointments and doesn’t care about other people’s time really.

We had a fight about money and his kids. His baby mama disappeared for two weeks leaving the kids with us but he wasn’t prepared to have them that long and I ended up footing the grocery bill (which upset me because I have a mortgage and a budget)  and the kids were upset they couldn’t contact their mom (she turned her phone off and blocked him from social media) so they took their frustrations out on me with name calling.  This put him in the middle as his kids were upset and I was upset. 
I started to resent him and the kids which started a fight. During this fight he said he was looking at other places to live so I said great I was going to kick you out anyways. Which wasn’t true I was just angry. He left for his cousins that night. I can be childish &amp; petty sometimes, so I hid our ‘relationship status’ on Facebook and we went a few days without contact.

We ended up getting back in contact and began hanging out again a few days later. He stayed over some nights as well and things seemed to be okay but then like three weeks later his band page posted a picture of him at a gig embracing a girl with his one hand on her butt and leaning in to kiss her. Of course this started another fight. He told me she’s his gf (35F) which hurts because we had only not been together for like a month at that point and he’s basically been with me or in contact with me every day and he’s cheated on this girl. 

 He can be a liar sometimes and he likes drama so I don’t know if this is just a game as whenever I ask why he’s not with his gf and with me instead he always has an excuse. Plus she lives about 45 minutes away and he doesn’t drive.
He said he loves me and likes spending time with me but he doesn’t want to put a time frame on us getting back together . He also is apparently leaving for tour in a few weeks which I found out from his manager. 

I love him and &amp; want to be with him but I don’t know if he’s just playing games and if I should just cut my losses?"
624,"&amp;#x200B;

I (M17) have been best friends with a friend since kindergarten. We have hung out a lot during our younger years but more recently it has only been about 3 hangouts a year. During these hangouts, my friend's cousins (F17) also comes aswell. This is usually because we hang out at their grandparent's house. During the younger years, I always thought his cousin was cute, but never tried to talk to her. This summer, however, we all got together once again and I've realized that I have a huge crush on her. I've known her my whole life, she's cute, and her personality is amazing. That day I was too nervous to ask for her number but my buddy pulled through and got it for me.

So we started talking at the beginning of the month. The issue is the convos aren't really the best. It usually has me leading the convo and her responding with only a few words. Sometimes she responds with paragraph but it's rare. This concerns me because after we started texting we all got together once again at their grandparent's house. I arrived before my buddy did. She and I were talking non-stop for about 20 mins. It was a really good convo and we were enjoying it. The 4 of us spent the rest of the day together. Throughout the hangout it seemed like when she was addressing the group she always was keeping eye contact with me, she sat by me (most of the time) when she could, and her focus was generally on me when things were happening.

Overall, the issue im concerned about is the texting. We go to different schools so the only way I can talk to her is through text. The texts are usually very boring and short, and all but 3 occasions I've texted first. When we texts she immediately replies when she starts texting back(sometimes not even closing the chat) but it isn't the best response. When I compliment her she always sends the blushing emoji but nothing much after. Shes semi-flirted with me on a few occasions but im not sure if it's her just being nice and genuine or she's flirting back. Is she just trying to be polite and be nice or is just genuinely interested in me. I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime this week and agreed, but then when trying to figure out the day she left me on read. The next day she replied saying she is busy somedays and our work schedule is conflicting with others, but we decided on a time before I go to work. She seems excited for it from what I can tell, but that is just from the few words she replies with.

SIDENOTE: At one point the grandma hinted that she did like me a year ago, but im not sure if it was true.

(I apologize for poor formating)"
625,I’m a female and my boyfriend wants me to take initiative but I don’t know how. How do I do this? Also this is my first relationship and I don’t know how to show your SO that you love them without telling them. What do you do to show them that you love them? Please help!
626,"It came to my attention this morning after my husband and I were fighting that the two of us don’t do anything together anymore, and I feel like we’re only still together because of our two year old son.

When we first started dating, everything was amazing. I had never felt such a strong connection to anyone, especially with someone who did so much to treat me right. Unfortunately after only about 2 months of dating, I found out I was pregnant. We decided we wanted to be together and have the child, so we did, and got married a little over a year after our son was born. It is almost our one year anniversary.

Now we argue and fight quite often. I have been a stay at home mom this whole time and try to get as much social time with friends as possible, but my friends and I enjoy smoking weed and my husband doesn’t, so he doesn’t like to partake in those hang outs. On the weekends while he works, I like to go over to my parents house(they live only 15 mins away) to visit and let them see their only grandson. And on husband’s days off, he wants us to stay home to spend time together.

But the thing is that we don’t spend time together at all. He does his own thing on his pc, and I do my own thing. We rarely watch movies or shows together, we don’t play games together, we don’t even sit together. The main thing we do together is argue about everyday things.

I just feel like it might be over. I still love him, but I also sometimes don’t want to be around him. And I can’t see how our current situation is great for our son.

I’ve thought about suggesting an open relationship with him, not really because I want to start sleeping with other people, but mainly to give ourselves time with other people which might help our stressing out at each other. I’ve also thought a bit about divorce. I’m not looking a lot into the divorce option because it really scares me.

Does anyone have any advise, or has anyone been in a similar situation that they solved? I will take any advice and just let me know if you need more info on anything."
627,"Context: My classmates and i needed to work on this volunteering assignment and we had the option to work together in groups. I asked one of my classmates (lets call him J) if he was willing to work with me and he said sure. Later on, i told my boyfriend about my volunteering assignment and he seemed cool with everything.

Fast forward to this morning, my classmate and I went to this school and asked if we can do some presentation for this assignment. After we got that done, J asked me if i wanted to go to lunch with him. I said sure thinking we would probably be discussing about the project. As it turned out, we just started talking about classes and reminiscing about high school. Later on, we somehow gotten into the topic of relationships and he asked me if i was single. I said no and i told him how my boyfriend and i met. He said he was dating this girl for a while and mentioned he was nervous about moving in with her. I told him he should do whatever he wants as long as his comfort and doesn't feel pressured to. 

After lunch ended and we said our goodbyes, i called my boyfriend called me after he was done with his shift at work. We talked about our day and he asked me what i did today. I said my classmate ask me to lunch and i joked around saying, ""hey why not? Free food!"" Even though we both paid separately. Then i told him a funny incident that happened where J made a dumb joke. My boyfriend was silent for a while and said, ""it sounds like you went on a date"" i didn't think it was a date and I explained i thought we we're going to talk about the project but we ended up talking about other stuff instead. He told me he needed time to process this and he'll talk to me in the morning. We both said our goodbyes and our love yous and that was it.

Thinking back on everything, i can see why it looks like a date and i shouldnt have joked around the way that i did. I feel super bad but I don't know what to do. At the time, i didn't think it was a date but just making a new friend. 

To give more context about our relationship, he has more experience with relationships than i do (being that this is my first relationship and him getting out of a abusive long-term relationship). I really like him and i do see a future with him but I'm afraid i fucked things up by not thinking things through. What can i do to rectify this situation?"
628,"To give some background me and this girl have being seeing each other for over a year, we had the ideal friends with benefits relationship for 6 months(which was ideal for me because I had a bad breakup recently), we'd go to concerts and travel the country together. she suffers from bipolar disorder and lives only with her father who isint supportive of her condition; one day her condition was so bad she attempted to kill herself by overdosing and after her failed attempt I cared for her for several days, this incident was what sparked our love for eachother; due to the incident she had to move out of state with her mom and we maintained contact. We ended up planning a month long trip together around the country and fell deeply inlove and by the end decided we wanted to date officially and do long distance (which i wanted to avoid so i wouldnt be heartbroken but i was weak). fast foward 5-6 months later we had visited eachother monthly and went on adventures together, some rough patches but overall the relationship was going well. a little over a week ago she called me telling me she no longer felt what she felt when we fell inlove during that trip and its better if we go back to being friends. she says she still feels for me more than a friend and still wants to talk daily and be  intimate with me. after this call she tried texting me a couple of times but ignored her  so i could detox from her and not let my sorrow interfere with my responsibilities and goals. I havent answered or talk to her in 4 days now. im very confused and not sure what to do should I speak to her once more or keep ignoring her? were both 22 yr old"
629,"I haven't slept properly in days. I can't eat. I can't drink. My anxiety is through the roof. My family doesn't know. I come from a very religious family. It's a long story but here goes:

I'm a 27 year old male. University educated. Healthy, fit. I have a career, I'm financially secure and fine. I support my younger siblings financially. I have 5 younger siblings all in their late teens to mid twenties. I live with all of them, its the culture I grew up in. You don't move out until you're married. I'm single, never married. I've never been in a serious relationship before. I'm definitely religious, but not a virgin.
This all began when I began working for the government with in a department I won't mention due to privacy. I was there for a year, worked 40 hours a week, kept my head down, etc. Then around Jan 2019 my boss was leaving to another department. I applied for the position but didn't get the job. Instead, they hired a new girl from the private sector.

We were around the same age. She's only 2 years older than me. But we couldn't be any different. She's white, tattooed, atheist. I'm Somali (black), Muslim, I introduced myself and she smiled at me. I tried to speak but I stuttered (I grew up with a stuttering problem but I outgrew it, however it comes back from time to time). I hurried back in my desk in embarrassment.
The first few months were normal.It was a huge learning curve for her. A lot of people questioned the hire but she quickly proved people wrong. She was smart, quick thinker, witty, no filter (once you get to know her).

That winter, I came out of the office one Friday afternoon and saw her car wasn't starting. It was super cold, and I gave her a boost. She was incredibly thankful and hugged me. I didn't think of it at all and went about my business.
Every month I have our monthly 1 on 1 meetings to discuss my performance. At first it was business as usual. But as the months wore on these meetings became more and more just as talking and catching up. She would ask me questions and we would chat about virtually anything. I also knew for a fact that she didn't do this for others. She was extremely professional with them. Again, my naive self didn't connect the dots. I know, stupid.

Meanwhile, at home, my mother is a commanding presence. I'm a 27 year old grown man and she lets me be usually, but still annoys me. If its after midnight she still calls asking where I am. Its super annoying but I love her to death. She's also been pushing me to get married. She keeps telling me that she knows many young girls back in Somalia that would be interested. I laugh it off but I knew she was serious.

Anyway, my boss at work would message me on the MSN chat that we have set up at work. It was just a casual conversation. One day when I was talking to her (I stutter and sometimes talk fast), I mentioned my brother, she misheard and thought I said my ""brother in law"". Her entire expression changed, as if it bothered her if I was married. When I clarified that she gave me a beamed smile. Hr smile was very attractive to me.
Then she added me on facebook. We chatted some more. Just friendly things. I considered telling a coworker who I trust, but I figured I couldn't do it. Too much gossip and just wasn't worth it.

Then came a celebration this past summer. A coworker invited all of us to Boston Pizza and many people from work came. I never drank a sip of alcohol in my life up until that point. I felt a little hazed but since I had half a cup I was still pefectly ok. I realized it was only me and her walking out together. There was a cab right in front of the place and I got in. I thought she was walking me to my cab but she went in the cab too. She gave the driver the address. I was shocked. Stunned. Mystified. When she touched my leg and started messaging my thigh I had a huge boner and couldn't control myself.
We went back to her apartment and had sex. Incredible sex. And yes, I used protection. She was so attractive it was mind boggling. She said she would get a tattoo with my name on it on her ass cheek. That turned me on more. She taught me different positions I didn't think of before.
I spent the night with her. The I panicked. I looked at my phone. It was 430am and I had 34 missed calls from my mother. I called her back telling her I was with my friend and would be staying at his for the night. I texted my friend and he covered for me. I know its pathetic at age 27 but what can you do.

The next morning I left and she kissed me goodbye. I left with regret because I went against my religion.

But it didn't end there.

The next working day she walked by my desk and handed me a small piece of paper. It had her number on it. I texted her and we swapped all of sorts of stuff to each other.
Long story short, I spent a lot of time at her apartment for the next 3-4 months. At first, the thrill and excitement was amazing. But then I began to really like her. But I was torn. I love my family too. But there was no way in a million years my mother would ever accept a her. Especially given that she's atheist.
Then the nightmare really began: I got a text from her saying she wanted to discuss something. I honestly thought it was because she wanted to end things. Which hurt me, but I thought it was for the best. When we did meet, she started with ""I didn't have my period this month"". It still didn't click for me. Then the following two words gave me a heart attack almost.

""I'm pregnant"".

My world shattered that instant. I thought to myself, ""how"". I've used protection every time I've been with her. But that didn't matter.
Then it hit me what I've been doing. I've been sleeping with my boss for 4 months now, putting both of our careers in jeopardy, and I've gotten her pregnant. To a girl my mother would NEVER EVER accept. Not only that, but this is not how I wanted to have a child.
But at the same time, I do like her. She's incredibly smart, attractive, fit, and really caring. However, with that being said, she can have some violent outbursts at times. She's not a morning person and can get extremely moody. But nobody is perfect.

She told me she is having the child whether I'm going to be involved or not. She told me she has feelings for me and is willing to try a relationship but not at this point in our careers at work. Abortion is out of the question anyway, its against my values and beliefs.

She told me I should tell my mother, but I don't have the stomach for it. I love my mother to death. I'd take a bullet for her anytime. But this would break her heart. She is incredibly religious and I know her. SHE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THIS. I don't want to burden her more, she has already been through a lot.

I like my girlfriend I guess you can call it, but I don't love her. I care about her future and her well being, but I'm conflicted if she's the person I want something long term with.

What should I do? I'm ready to be a father, but not like this? My family will disown me. They wouldn't want to meet her. My community will shun me.

I've never been depressed like this before. Any solid advice would be appreciated."
630,"We have been together for going on four years. We have a two year old son. It has gotten very toxic the last few months and she couldn't take it anymore.. I'm not sure what advice I'm looking for but I'm at a loss. To keep it short we got into an argument (almost two weeks ago) about her talking to her ex and friends she has had relations with that I was not comfortable with her talking too. She started talking to them again and I blew up unfortunately (I'm very insecure about the situation) instead of talking like an adult and she walked out. I didn't know where she was for a few days. She told me she dropped our son off her sisters and stayed with a friend.  Iv been trying to talk to her over text and she says she is tired of being in a toxic environment and doesn't see us getting back together...  Mostly ignoring my texts unless its about our son. Today she stopped by the apt to talk and get clothes for her father's funeral, he died a few days ago unfortunately.. I tried to keep my calm and not stress her out but I ended up crying and asking for her to not give up hope between us.. i told her im here for her if she would like company at his funeral.. I told her I will always be here to help her and our son. she wants the best for me and for me too find someone that will make me happy. But she does not see us happening. She keeps saying little things that make me think there's someone else .. I want her to be happy... I want to be spending my life and time with her.. I realize I shouldn't be concerned with what she is doing but it bothers me if I'm being honest... I realize I have issues and so does she but I'm not ready to give up.. I told her I will be working on myself and making sure her and our son are taken care of. I love her deeply so I'm trying to leave her alone but all I wanna do is hold her and talk... I'm going to try my best to keep my distance for a while but still be here for her if she needs of wants me. I will not do this forever and may one day find someone else.. but right now and probably for a while I will be focused on my family that is broken... I love her...  Iv tried to stay busy and see other people but I think it's just to soon.. it does nothing for me even know they tell me I'm great.. they are not who I want to hear it from... I would like your input or opinion. It may help..."
631,"Hello, so as I said I am a 20 year old male, she's my first girlfriend so I don't know how to act or understand certain situations or actions.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND (Yes, some of the things I'm going to write now are gonna sound childish but this relationship is childish since we are fairly young, please understand)

So we met like 3 months ago, she's from a wealthy religious family, I am from a middle class one, I am not religious, she has like 2000 followers on Instagram and I have 200, I am better looking than her (I'm the reacher socially, she is physically), **I've never had a serious GF** (used to be very shy before) **she's had two BF (they both cheated on her)**, one of her EX BFs is an Instagram model and she likes every photo of him.

So let's start, as I said **she said to me she was very religious** but on the first date we went to the back of my car and she touched me, I got her almost naked, we had a very nice time. (She said to me I was the first guy to see her in that state and the first one to touch)

We kept texting and everything**, we see each other once a week**, I have to go to her house in my car (**lives like 40 minutes away from me**) or her parents drive her here.

To keep things simple, **we kept texting, hanging out** and **she told me that she was very attached and attracted** to me and everything...

**I asked her to be my Girlfriend 10 days ago** **after** dating and going out for like **two months**... (all her friends were asking her when I would ask her and why was I so slow and everything and her too so I did it)

10 days ago, when I asked her I had a really good time that day with her and thought it'd be a good idea, and for the moment it has not been.

**There's things that annoy me**, I have her number saved on my phone as: ""Cutie(heart emoji)"" and in two different days that we've met I've seen she has changed my name from ""Boyfieeeee(heart emoji X5)"" to ""Didier"", isn't it weird? Yes I know it sounds childish as hell **but why would you change your boyfriend contact name everytime you are not with him to just his name?** All my friends GF don't do that at least...

Besides that she uploaded a screenshot of a conversation with me to her IG close friends and she covered my name...

I don't know she was the sweetest girl ever but since she's been my GF we text much less and I feel like there's no connection or chemistry anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

Today we met, I drove to her house, I was not very charming, I was cold as hell if I'm being honest when I got there but I tried to be but then **I saw my contact saved as ""Didier""** and I felt hurt, not that I care much about these things but coming from her yes because s**he's the type of girl who would save her boyfriend as 'BestbfeverIloveyou'** so that's one thing, apart from that **she likes every single photo of her EX BF** (I doubt he cares since he's an IG model), then we walked, sat and everything but we didn't feel that spark, we used to laugh saying and doing stupid stuff...

So I drove back to her house (we were in some shop) and I was talking to her maid and my GF tells me ""you should be leaving, it's becoming late"" and I replied 'Oh so you are kicking me out' jokingly  while her maid was there and she(maid) agreed with me that it was a bit rough to say... **I left, I got home and she uploaded an IG close friends story that said: ""The only good thing of today is that I can sleep early""**, later she sent me like 15 texts asking for forgiveness for being so childish and stupid, and stuff like that, haven't replied to her yet. 

So it's not very cheap to go to her house because of petrol and highway fares, so it's an effort going there and her saying that hurts...

Yes I'm very much aware that my reasons for doubting her may sound childish as hell, but I feel like being treated poorly because I am the one who has to drive to her house to be with her annoying family just to be with her, I am the one who has always supported and listened to her with her problems and stuff, I am the one who has had to put up with her 'bitchy days' and just because today I was cold for literally 10-15 minutes I deserve to be treated as that the rest of the evening?

Keep in mind that **her school graduation is this Friday** and I was supposed to go there and be with her and everything, how things are going **I doubt I'm attending that...**

&amp;#x200B;

I thought she was the best girl ever, charming, sweet, gentle, but those little things annoy me and make me doubt of her, I'd like opinions please, and if you want to know more details then tell me but I've tried to keep this 'short' so I didn't write some things, thank you very much for your patience and advice."
632,"my boyfriend and i have been dating for a little over 4 months, but before we started dating we were best friends. we’ve been best friends since about a year before we started dating. when we first started dating, i wasn’t sure if i wanted to be in a relationship with him, but i did it anyways because i care about him so much. i hope this doesn’t sound conceited in a way, but i can really tell how much he loves me and it sucks to not feel the same way for him. another issue is that he is constantly wanting to hangout which i know is normal for a relationship, but it becomes really hard with all the school work they give us and all the AP classes i’m taking. the confusing thing is that we both care about school so much and he is also in all AP classes so he knows how important it is to focus on school work, but he still gets upset when i can’t hangout every day. i end up hanging out with him because i feel bad, but i can feel myself falling behind on my school work because of it. whenever we hangout, we don’t have sex but we do other things and it doesn’t feel as exciting as everyone says it should.  i know this is all really wrong, but i don’t want to hurt him at all because he is such a good guy. i feel like i’m never going to find someone who loves me as much as he does, and someone who i can honestly have such a good time with when i hangout with them. i feel like there’s something wrong with me for not feeling the same way he feels about me since i see him as the picture perfect guy, and i know in the future he is going to make someone very happy, i just can’t see it being me. it sucks because if i break with him i’m going to be losing my absolute best friend who i tell everything and has been there for me for the longest time, and we’re in the same friend group so it would make everything very awkward. if someone has ever been in a similar situation please tell me what to do!!

edit: this post made it seem like i despise hanging out with him which i definitely don’t, we have such a great time together most of the time it’s just that i can’t get myself to hangout with him all of the time, and the sexual part of our hangouts just aren’t as exciting and sort of feel like a chore, as horrible as it sounds."
633,"Hey redditors!

So there is this guy who I have loved for a long time. He was my best friend when we were younger and he asked me out. However at the time, there was a game the boys were playing: the boys would dare each other to ask out a girl and then break up with her after a few days together. So when he asked me that, I kept that game in thought and rejected him. Afterwards, he started distancing himself from me.

Fast-forward to 2017. We became friends again and he was still one of the sweetest guys I knew. However, I couldn't bear to be around him because by then my feelings were so strong for him. So I did the only logical thing I could think of, I graduated high school two years early in hopes of being able to get over him. The results: IT WORKED. I was finally over him.

However, we now go to the same community college. I know that I no longer have feelings for him and I'm pretty sure that he doesn't have feelings for since he has a girlfriend. We have kept in contact once in awhile and are on friendly terms with each other.

I want to lift the burden off of my shoulders and confessed my feelings from before. I don't like him anymore. I am also leaving to the states soon for university and I don't want to leave any stone unturned before then.

Is it alright for me to do so? Though I am not going to outright say I loved him. Just that I had feelings for him back then."
634,"Hi Reddit, throwaway account because obvious reasons. So as a bit of backstory, I (28F) collect anime figures, mostly Figma and SH Figuarts. I have these displayed in a glass case in the living room. I am very meticulous about the placement of these figures. It's very obvious to me when they're not arranged exactly as I left them, as I have put hours into posing them just so. A few weeks ago I started to notice that my figures looked off. My Sailor Moon figure's wand wasn't as high up as it should be, my Mikasa wasn't positioned close enough to Eren, etc. I live with my bf (27M), who was laid off a couple months ago and is at home the majority of the day. My first instinct was thinking that he was playing with them while I was at work, maybe posing them to his own liking then putting them back as he remembered. I also have sent him pictures of my display from before we lived together, so he has those to go off as well. Though I found this idea a tad annoying, I didn't say anything because we've been fighting a lot about unrelated things. I can tell he's really stressed out dealing with unemployment. I also liked the idea of us enjoying the same weird hobby. Maybe once he gets back on his feet he'll start buying his own figs?

However, a couple hours ago I came home to him standing over the sink rinsing off my Ryuko Figma. I asked him what he was doing, and he said the display was looking dusty so he thought he'd do some cleaning. I'm guessing he spilled soda on it or something like that while playing around with it. I haven't confronted him yet, I just went into the bedroom and typed this up. Is there a nice way to tell him to stop messing around with my collection without it spiraling into a huge fight about something like me not trusting or appreciating him? Is it better if I save the conversation for after he gets a new job? I love him so much and fully understand that he has too much time on his hands right now, but I also want to nip this in the bud before he inevitably breaks or loses something. 

tl;dr Stressed out, unemployed bf keeps playing around with my expensive toy collection to the point that I'm worried about him damaging things. Please advise."
635,"I met my friend at the beginning of high school. 

We decided we would move in together last spring, and I spent roughly three months looking for rentals for the start of university. I contacted landlords and sent off countless emails. I eventually found our current apartment, set up a viewing, prepared our documents and faxed the paper work. I found us a roommate through Facebook when our other friend backed out. In short, I handled the logistics, all the while asking her to look online as well.

Throughout the past 2 months since moving in, she has been consistently difficult to live with. She does the typical make a mess in the kitchen and leave it. On one particular occasion, she made a large meal, and then left for the entire weekend without cleaning up. 

She rarely brings down the trash or recycling. She lets her compost get smelly and moldy. She has cleaned the bathroom she and I share possibly once. She leaves the main door unlocked and empty’s the Britta without refilling it. She prays with her boyfriend on the phone every school night after our 11pm quiet hour. 

In addition to this, she has become increasingly unkind. She has made insulting comments about a difficult time I confided in her about. 

My other roommate and I have been upfront about what our standards are, and what we expect from the three of us. It is a lovely rental that I would like to see respected and maintained properly. 

I don’t foresee her changing how she behaves, as it has been two months. I routinely (politely) ask her to pitch in. 

How and when would you suggest I ask her to move out? She will be going home for the summer in April and our lease is up August 1st. I would like to stay in the apartment likely for the duration of my degree. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
636,"I live in a uni house of 5, with one of my flat mates being my now ex girlfriend. Over the past few weeks I’ve been thinking about what’s going to happen post graduation, she lives about 150 miles away from me, and she is living at her parents for at least a year to do teacher training. I want to spend some time at my family house having just been away at uni for 3 years, but she wanted us to meet in the middle after a year and get a place together. I love her with all my heart, yes I think we have issues but I really am in love with her, but I broke up with her because I was scared it wouldn’t work long term. Everyone is telling me, I should of tried to make it work long term, and not just given up, but I had fears about taking the leap and moving away to be with her and it all falling apart. Has anyone been in a similar situation?"
637,"I mentioned it to him before. He gives a little more effort like trying to give compliments. Now he says things like „you look good today“. Before that there was nothing.

But I still feel really anxious because he doesn’t really express his emotions. I don’t want to drive him away with being clingy. 
I’m even overthinking if I should call him on the phone or not because I feel like it will bother him. And he is a bad texter, so I mostly get short answers.
He is not crazily busy with work/studies or friends. He spends more time at home than outdoor.


It’s my(27f) first relationship and his(26m) first relationship."
638,"If you made it to this post after that clusterfuck of a title, please hear me out. English is not my mother tongue, so please excuse any mistakes I make while creating this post.

Long-time ""Crush"" (F18): Kaitlyn, Other Girl (F18): Judy  (Obviously no real names mentioned.)

So, a few years ago (about 4 or 5 to be specific), I met this girl in one of my classes, Kaitlyn. As I am, she was a really shy person, so we didn't really talk too much at first. About 2 years ago now, we started talking regularly, getting closer from time to time. It wasn't much longer, until I somehow developed romantic feelings for her (I think?) even though we were pretty good friends - like only friends. There was never any signs of her having any interest in me except for her becoming more and more shy towards me. As I mentioned earlier, she was pretty shy when I met her so I wasn't suspecting anything. That was until a friend of hers told me, that she was allegedly crushing on me too,  about two weeks ago or so. The scaredy cat I am, I hadn't confessed to her (or anyone at all) that I was in love with her. 

About 1.5 weeks ago, she unexpectedly told me that she was going to throw a birthday party and that she would love for me to be there. Of course I accepted and went to her birthday party. She was celebrating together with another friend who turned 18 recently too, but it was only their closest friends, which resulted in overall 6 people as their social group basically matched entirely. I knew everyone there from school, except for one person, Judy. Even though I obiously went to Kaitlyns birthday to spent some time with my ""Crush"", but as I got introduced to the Girl I didn't know (Judy), everything changed completely. I've never felt something like this, but if I were to say it, it was ""Love at first sight"". I don't know how to describe it, but Judy was the most amazing person I had ever met. We had a blast together and got to know each other quite well. As the party ended, we exchanged social information and since then we've been texting. I don't think anyone at the party actually realized anything as it wasn't like I didn't talk to everyone else.

It's been about a week now and I'm still wondering about what happened to me as I never actually believed in ""love at first sight"" and all of that other stuff. I also don't know what happened to my feelings for Kaitly, as I don't feel like I like her any less than before. The last thing I want is to make anyone involved unhappy, but after trying to sort my feelings for about a week, I haven't made any progress at all. The only thing I've been able to think about was Judy and to meet her again sometime soon.

Of course, I'm not here for someone to tell me who to choose, but I'd appreciate any suggestions on this situation or maybe an explanation what happened to me. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear how it played out.

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading and please don't judge me :)"
639,"Alight, I'll get into the actual situation here. My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2 years now. She was my first relationship and I was her first serious relationship. For the beginning part of my relationship, I was the happiest person I had ever been in my entire life. I grew a lot as a person while I dated her. Everything just felt so natural. If something happened, she was the first person who I would tell and she would always be there to cheer me up. We both have always had issues with anxiety, and we were able to use each other as support systems to vent out our frustration. And for the longest time this worked super well.

Eventually though, I started to noticed that instead of venting her frustrations, it felt like she was directly getting frustrated with me. Keep in mind, I admit that I don't do everything perfectly, but it felt like she would take the stress of her day and attribute it to the small mistake that I would do. If it was every once in awhile, I would be fine, except I started noticing it more and more frequently as we got into spring of this year. We began to argue and bicker a great deal more then we used to and I started to get frustrated. Summer was coming up and we were both working in the same area so I told myself that things had to get better otherwise I would have to go on a break. We are both in college so summer seemed like a good test run for after school because we wouldn't have weird schedules like we did over the school year. I was hopeful going into this summer that things would get better

Instead, things just seemed to spiral even more. Our disagreements were even more constant and our conversation were more volatile. At one point, her self esteem seemed to be so low that she asked why I hadn't left because she feels like she would have chased everyone else away. This hurt me the most because despite all the heartache and stress, I still love her, and it felt like she had given up on the relationship for a period.

I still stayed with her until the end of the summer but things had not gotten better. I started to get anxiety when I was around her or we were going to meet up. At that point, I had to take a break. During that break, I talked to a lot of my friends and told the story just as I did here (except a bit more in depth). I then said I was considering breaking up with her entirely and they could all see my rationale in doing it. Eventually, I did break up with her but I missed her terribly. I would be incredibly down and wish that I could talk to her again. It felt like my best friend had died.

Soon we got back back together to try it out because we were both doing awfully without each other. For the first two weeks I was feeling comfortable again but now I have started to get that same anxiety, even though the situation is nothing like it is over the summer. I am spending large portions of my day contemplating our relationship. When we are apart I notice I am not excited to see her like I used to be for over two years now. When we are together, it is mostly fine except I notice that I am not being as physical as we used to be, and she has noticed too. I don't know if this is some sort of emotional anxiety related to the fear of it all falling apart again or if this is signaling that we should have stayed broken up.

To sum it all up, I am very conflicted about what to do and i feel like this is all at her expense too, which is unfair to her. I wish i could just say I was comfortable in the relationship rn but in all honesty I am not. I hope this is just a passing thing but for some reason there is a big mental block in my head about what to do.

If any of you have any advice as to what to do, big or small, I would be really appreciative. This is my first relationship and regardless of what we have been through, I still love and care about her deeply, and I just need some help to figure out what is the best for both of us."
640,So I’m 15. Boyfriend is 16 ( I turn 16 soon). We grew  up together and he moved to the state above me to be closer to family. We’re 4 months strong but very recently his grandmother passed and I just don’t know what to do? I can’t physically show him compassion so how do I cheer him up? It hurts so bad to see him like this. He’s barely spoken to anyone.
641,Looking for individuals with experience. Please tell me your story.
642,"Ok so I’m my last post I said I liked this girl but now I kinda don’t and this other girl I do but the one I dont like goes to my school and is in my 3rd hour what do I do and I’m giving her one of my hoodies and I don’t want to egg her on and keep it going but I also don’t want to make her feel bad 😢 please help me ASAP ⁉️⁉️⁉️ they are both 17 I’m 18

643,"Ok, my spouse is extremely hardworking, entrepreneurial and ambitious.  I love him. With that said,  there are Many things lacking in our relationship: 
I have three children. I do all the logistics.  His job in a sense is to provide and my job is to manage. He doesn’t do anything logistical for the children but procure for
The family.  He is extremely good at what he does and I am thankful for that.   I know He is so stressed with many things at work. .....He came home tonight after traveling, and wanted to watch a specific sporting event. After finally putting Thur kids to bed, I, too, wanted to watch something else- no big deal.  At that time, He was even sweet enough to offer to let me watch my show while He watches his event on his phone.  The problem is - his tone. And I addressed it.    He is kind of an asshole. I have been waiting for him all day and I’ve wanted to sit next to him on the couch, which caused a huge deal.   We start to argue about this. And it escalated into fuck you territory. We have never said that to each other. A couple of f’s, stormed into room, he’s watching his game. Etc.   
What do I do? Do I apologize? I was the one who said F off.   But is still feel
He should Have been nicer to me. He was inconsiderate with his tone and mean to me.  Ugh"
644,"I recently got into a relationship with a great guy, we have a lot of fun and match really well. The problem is he keeps story topping my stories (eg I’m talking about my struggles with finding a job and he doesn’t say anything supportive but just tops my story by talking about how he struggled even more when he was applying for jobs) and also he very rarely asks me any questions about my day or week even after I ask him tons of questions, he can talk for hours without asking me anything. Sometimes I just talk about my things and he has to listen. 

How can I bring this to his attention in a nice way? Does he not care about me or is this just an immature trait?"
645,"I have been contemplating for weeks and have come to the conclusion that for many many reasons my relationship needs to end for now. I won’t go into much more detail than that because whether or not to do that is not the advice I am seeking.

I am madly in love with my boyfriend, and have wanted nothing more than to be with him and plan for our future, but for reasons I know are right I need to end it. We both will be better off for now. Any advice on how to actually follow through and deal with the heartbreak that I am going to feel after? Thank you."
646,"I don’t know what it is about me but women hate me. I’m kind of an incel but I’m only half blackpilled and women tend to avoid me. Except for my girlfriend, a transwoman. She is a legit 8/10 and she has had the surgery too. She actually passes as a woman. Not that I have anything against transgenders who don’t pass! 

The problem is, I will never be able to get past the fact that she was born a male. I don’t want my first experience with a woman to be with somebody who was born male. It kinda disgusts me to think about to be honest. I know it probably sounds transphobic to a lot of people but I don’t hate transgenders. I’m just not sure if her neovagina will feel like the real thing.

We haven’t done it yet but we’ve been dating for about a month and it might come up. And right now I’m super okay with just making out. But if she brings it up, I don’t know if I’m just going to run out of the room unable to answer her. Should I break up with her and go back to being an incel?"
647,"I’ve been talking to this guy(20) for the last three months. He and I went to high school together, I(21) wouldn’t say we were friends but more acquaintances. We were both in the same friend group but honestly I wasn’t too fond of him, he made these weird jokes that I never got and I just found him annoying but all my friends liked him so I would put up with him lol. 

I was a year above him so when I graduated high school almost four years ago, we stopped talking, the only time I’ve seen him since was we went over to a mutual friend of ours a couple months after graduation.  

Anyways, he messaged me on Facebook a couple months back out of nowhere. We started talking and things progressed. I feel as if he has matured since high school and become a much more tolerable person considering that I have a huge crush on him now and he feels the same way. We went on a couple dates and they were amazing and over this time we have built a great friendship and I feel so comfortable with him and I’m just so glad to have him in my life. Who would have thought I would have felt this way about him in high school. 

Anyways, my parents were familiar with him because he was also friends with my younger brother, they were on the wrestling team together and share a birthday so they knew him and I would also complain to them how annoying I found him. Last night I brought him over for dinner and told them we are dating. Once he left the reaction of my dad was unbelievable. He made all these racist comments and presented me with these “statistics” of why I should not date a black guy and I’m so disgusted by his behavior. 

And to make matters worst, my mom/ his wife is also black. Me and my brother are both mixed race and his wife is black and now he’s basically telling me that half of me isn’t good enough for the world and people like my mom are a menace to society. I’m still shocked by what I heard, and my mom just stood there and didn’t say anything. Eventually she told me to do whatever makes me happy but how can she stand there and let someone say stuff like that about basically who she is. 

At the end of the day, I’m not gonna judge him based of statistics, he is an amazing guy. The friendliest guy you will ever meet, and to hear him make these assumptions about him, me, my brother and my mom is just so heart wrenching. 

And the biggest thing is that I’m considering moving out now. I graduate the end of this semester and already have a job lined up, I have money saved up and don’t think I can live with him anymore. I’ve just never been this angry before."
648,"I (27F) am looking to change jobs and communities in order to build a life with my BF (31M) and his child (5F).

  We're coming up on our two-year anniversary and things have been going well.  We're taking a vacation together this summer, we've both expressed that we'd like kids (especially me, as I don't have one of my own yet).  We're both courteous and make an effort to communicate even when it's uncomfortable, and we've proven that we co-operate well through a variety of activities.

I currently have a full time permanent career and would be taking a risk by leaving it.  I feel like my confidence flips and flops...I'm confident that we would be happy together, but I'm also pragmatic in recognizing that anything can happen.  I guess I'm just nervous...

What do you think?"

650,"Me (M32) and my partner (F28) have been together for a touch over 3 years now and have been living together quite happily for the past year. She's returned to study we've recently adopted a dog, so money has been a bit more restricted and less frivolous.

The other night over dinner, she asked if her friend (M28) could move in with us when our current lease is up. He still lives at home with his parents and brother but is looking to get out, although can't afford a place which is to his liking and doesn't have many friends to move in with. My partner has no hesitations on helping her friend out.

I've lived with my fair share of housemates in the past and am pretty content with just me, my partner and the dog. My partner has moved out of her parents place and only lived with one other couple, then by herself and now with me.

The pro's would be we can split the new rent and bills three ways helping us financially. We would be helping her friend move out and get some independence. He's a pretty chilled guy and I get along with him fairly well. Although, I think he's missing out on trying to find a solution for himself and spreading his wings. I've met some great people and learned a lot by house sharing with random people. I think it's a good thing to live and learn.

I'm concerned it will impact on our home life, as I don't get comfortable around people too easy and just like to be a bit of slob (wear my sweats and not care about my appearance and behavior so much). I'm a bit over house sharing and would have thought she would have been a bit more reserved on her decision.

I'm looking to get some input whether I should help her friend out or whether I'm being too selfish in saying no?"
651,"We're both college students, we both have jobs and a bunch of classes and I totally get that she's busy. Her and I have been on two dates, pretty casual. We're not calling it exclusive yet but we both like each other and want to go on more dates.

But now every time I ask her to do something, she's just too busy. I try to work between her schedule and offer those times but she says she needs to do homework. It seems she's super busy and has been for the past two weeks. She has no idea when she won't be busy and it seems next week is full too. I'm starting to think that maybe she just isn't that interested anymore... even though she tells me she wants to do something again.

What should I do here? We still text every day or two, we talk during class and I feel some chemistry. But I don't know how she can be this busy."
652,"Hi. this is my first post ever (F18). i'm very scared and this is out of my element. i wanted to appear anonymous but i couldn't figure out how to Dx. but i need some help. 

if my bf reads this i'm gonna be very embarrassed honestly. I need to learn to go to him only but I just need help right now. i'm probably gonna delete this soon. 

my boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years. I don't imagine myself being with anyone else. he helps me in ways I never knew were possible, and he makes me feel happy and loved in ways I couldn't imagine. 

he's had a difficult past. so when I have problems, I feel like a terrible person going to him because he is already having his own burdens and setbacks. my love language is physical touch, and when i'm upset that need skyrockets. but him, he wants to be alone and refuses help. I respect this, and don't push him further until he is ready.  but my need for touch is still there, and when he walks away or leaves I get sad. I hate myself for it, it is incredibly selfish and stupid. but no matter what, I cannot shake this feeling. (I always end up talking to him about it, and soon after I feel much better) but I feel like a terrible person. 

is there anything I can do to stop this? 

sorry for bad formatting and english. i'm very shy. 

TL;DR:  my love language is touch and I feel like a bad person asking for it and being sad if it doesn't happen when my bf is having his own problems. I need helping preventing this."
653,"Im 14 days out of him breaking up with me. It’s very tough. I really want to talk to him tonight, but I know I should give him more space/time. My previous post outlines where my mindset is on my ex. 

I’m trying to understand how and why I only managed to meet 1 of his friends over the course of 18 months, while he met most of mine. And he hung out with my “group” plenty of times. 

I did meet all of his family. Went to the holiday/reunion stuff and all. 

But It’s really strange that 2 days after we break up, he hung out with 4-6 friends I had never met before. I know they are old friends. Probably from college. But still, seems he was able to bring the gang back together rather quickly? Or was it planned for a while and he didn’t want me to meet them so he broke up with me?

It’s just one of those nights where reflecting on my ex is overly complicated.."
654,"Me: M15 Her:F14

I've liked this girl for at least 7 months now, we just started being friends at the beginning of the school year but I messed up. I Don't have good looks and the only thing that I do have is my comedy skills. Honestly I really messed up, I ignored her for a whole day and when she asked I told her she was annoying and that her actions are irritating me. I didn't mean it whole heartedly be at some degree I had an outburst and that means it's true. She's now avoiding me and when I tried to talk to her it felt like she wwas on the moon slowly moving away from the earth which was me. Please help me and tell me what I should do, I really f%cked up and I don't care if she likes me back I just want to be friends again, to be able to make her laugh makes me happy. Afterall, it's the only thing that keeps me from snapping sometimes."
655,"Long story short- got back in contact with this guy I met at uni, he messaged me we talked for a month before meeting up due to schedules and distance. The first date was amazing and so we met up a further two times to spend weekends with each other. I felt I could really be myself around him, we have the same weird sense of humour and he agreed. So I thought things were heading in a good direction. He’s 3 hours away currently so we only met up 3 times in 4 months. When we weren’t with each other we texted every day constantly without fail and used Snapchat to share bits of our day with the other. Anyway, at the 5 month mark communication on his end started to drop off. I understand that he was busy with studying (PA masters) but 2 days delay without a word and no explanation, is a bit much I feel. I brought this up to him and he said ‘sorry not sorry’ because we were still having a conversation on snapchat. This happened a few more times - he’d just leave the conversation and sometimes not respond to a question I had asked, beginning a new conversation much later. I told him that it would be okay with me if we stopped talking at this point if he was too busy etc etc. To which he replied ‘why would I want to stop talking to you’  and so his texting picked back up again for a little while. He then relapsed into old habits sometimes now taking as much as 4 days to reply. He had exams coming up but even in my busiest exam period at uni, I had time to send a simple text even one that said I was busy and would get back to whoever it was - just out of respect you know. At this point we weren’t even really talking on Snapchat either. So I messaged him asking him if maybe we should stop seeing each other. He acknowledged he’d been shit and said that ‘he couldn’t have anything serious right now because he wouldn’t have time to give to the person [he was seeing]’ he said that he’d want to see me but again reiterated that it wouldn’t be serious right now. He did however say he’d like to ‘stick around’ for when I’m a doctor in 6 years...though I’m not sure in what capacity and that he’s there ‘whenever I need him’. He also said that he didn’t want to stop speaking to me and we agreed to have some space (his idea)

It’s been nearly a month since ‘space’ began and we still talk, 9 times out of 10 he initiates conversation asking me questions etc and seemingly trying to lengthen the conversation. I’ll reply then he’ll drop off the map again. Why does he keep doing this? I’m fine not to talk right now but if he doesn’t want to talk, why does he keep initiating?

TL;DR - tried to break it off with a guy because I didn’t feel like a priority, he suggested space. I don’t know what to do!"
656,"TL;DR Ex called it off after 3 years its been 4 months and I still get random flashbacks of her I dont think its normal to still miss her. If not idk how to get over her. 

Nearly 4 months ago my(18) ex(17) decided it was time to call it off for the last time. We had taken breaks in the past because of personal and family problems which I was perfectly fine with when they were needed and she said she was fine with as well that happened a couple times. Towards the end of our overall 3 year romance and 5 year friendship I was completely unsuspecting and unaware of what she felt or why she felt that way. She talked like she was happy the way she always had when she was fine we had an agreement to make sure we communicate best we can whats going on which I feel is important if you want a lasting relationship. That being said the last month of us quickly deteriorated I went on vacation with my family for 2 weeks and I promised to text her everyday I was there like I always did when I was out of town and she didnt respond at all the entire 2 weeks I was gone nor the next few days after I had got back. When I asked her what was up all she said when I finally got a hold of her was that she made some new friends. I was initially upset by this but didn't want to think bad of it because I knew she struggled with meeting people so I convinced myself she needed the friends and thats all it was. But the ""ghosting"" continued for another 2 weeks really only saying a word or two to me every few days. Until she finally told me that she wasn't ready for a relationship anymore. Followed by getting blocked by her on pretty much any point of contact I had with her(not phone). I was so confused i needed to know what was going on I tried everything I could to get to her show her that I care and can help her through whatever it was she was going through. I texted her and called nearly everyday. Even contacted some my friends that I knew she hung out with only for them to call me a POS and block me as well. When she finally faced me one last time she told me she was going through a lot with her family. I again offered my support I was sure she needed it. She then went on to say how she was so unhappy for the past YEAR!!!? She said I hadn't been giving her enough attention or support or affection for so long and that the only reason she got back with me the last time was because she felt bad for me. She went on to just kinda of call me an awful person let alone boyfriend in all kinds of ways when I had never realized she felt that way at all or for this long. I didn't respond with anything but sorry before I watched her walk away for the last time. Throughout the time we dated I gave up the friends she didn't like all I cared about was making her happy I gave her all the free time I could even making freetime just to see her an extra hour a week. But I guess the past year didn't really mean anything including all the times she asked me for sex or for fancy things which I couldnt always afford but I'd blow whatever little cash I had leftover on her. 

Now its been 4 months since she walked away and I get 3-4 flashbacks of her a week and miss her a lot. I don't think this is normal since she seemed to have no feelings at all left when she ended it I dont think Ive ever heard anyone speak to me with such hatred before besides my father."
657,"My boyfriend has been the best thing that’s happened to me in a long time. We’re together frequently despite us going to different schools almost an hour away from each other, we go out on dates and are overall very happy. However, I’ve had severe depression since middle school and he doesn’t understand it. 

I made him aware of my severe depression and anxiety early on in our relationship so it wouldn’t come as a surprise. He said he would support me but recently it hasn’t felt like it. I’ll express my worries and thoughts and I usually receive a blank text or a change in subject. I really want support from him because he’s one of the most important people in my life but I’m feeling alone in my emotional struggles. I’ve brought up wanting support before and he says he’s there to help me but it feels completely one sided. Am I expecting too much/have a false view of what he should be doing for me or is this a genuine concern I should have?"
658,"My GF and I have been dating for 5 years and it has been like any other relationship, however, we have definitely reached a new low. We have both just transferred to different schools and live 20 mins away from each other, so we see each other rather often. Whenever my GF gets stressed out about anything, it be school, work, or family issues, she goes for me and calls me names and yells at me and just acts like she generally dislikes me. Not keeping a count or anything, but for example, over the past week:

* She woke up late for work because her phone did not sound her alarm, and she ended up 15 mins late. I stayed over at her apt. so I could drive her to work that morning as she does not have a car on campus. She blamed me for the alarm not going off because I put it to charge the night before and it updated, making her alarm silent. I apologized profusely and she called me names like bitch, ass, and idiot.
* My car broke down on the side of the highway 20 mins away from her when she was at home, so she drove 20 mins to come to me even though I said it was okay as the AAA service was coming anyways. After picking me up she was angry at me for not thanking her for coming and how she could have spent her time doing more productive things.
* I got cranky and fell silent when she called me stupid and then proceeded to tell me that I am emotionally abusive (she says this a lot) for punishing her for something that she didnt do. 

I'm not gonna keep going because theres a lot more and I don't remember all of it but this is all relatively new. Whenever I tell her that the way she talks to me hurts my feelings, she tells me that she acts that way because of the environment I put around her, and how ultimately it is my fault. I try to never place blame anywhere in a relationship because it goes both ways, but I am at a loss here at what to do. Breaking up is not an option, I have talked to her so many times about how I feel but it just does not go anywhere so I just have to fake it till I make it to seem happy. She also has some body image issues and is in general very stressed out and anxious, but so am I, and I would never call her names like that. I have recommended that she go to a therapist or a counselor like I do, but she says that she doesnt need to and that every therapist she has been with tells her to break up with me. Im very confused and I dont know if I really am the problem or what is happening but please someone share their perspective on this."
659,"This might get lost in here, but I’m not sure what other subreddit to go to. Also keep in mind I’ve had one actual relationship my entire life and I have little to no idea how dating works, but I’m trying to figure it out.

I (20, F) started working a new job at night and there was this guy that immediately caught my attention. As a couple days went on he started routinely coming up to me and asking if I had my break already. Like every night I was there. I assumed it was because I’m new and he was just looking out for me. Then as time went on, he would have little conversations with me, and then on a slow night he offered to help me pack out boxes and after spending 5 hours together we found out some basic stuff about each other (like we’re both taking a break from school, he moved to NJ from Brooklyn, we both like anime, etc).

Fast forward to two weeks later, I find out I have to be transferred because my mom is a day supervisor at that same store and there’s a conflict of interest. I mention to my mom that I think he’s cool and interesting, and she offers to get me his number. She’s a manager on duty some days so she has a log of everyone’s name &amp; number on file. At first I thought it was strange but then I realized I’m never going to see him again or talk to him in person since he works after the store closes and I’m transferring. So I told her to give it to me.

I texted him just saying hello, and explained to him that I didn’t know if he knew I had to be transferred but that I asked my mom for his number because I wanted to thank him for his help with training me (he actually did teach me a lot that one day) and that’s it. Nothing flirty or suggestive. It’s been 5 hours and I’ve heard nothing back.

I have extremely debilitating social anxiety and a massive fear of rejection so putting myself in a situation to be shut down took every ounce of energy in me. Part of me is like it could be that he’s busy at work, or he was sleeping, or just not on his phone. The other part is saying that he thinks it’s creepy I got his phone number without him actually giving it to me and that no 23 year old goes 5 hours without looking at their phone.

So did I go too far? Should I have just let a crush be a crush? How else should I have handled it if there was no way for me to see him again?

TLDR; I got a former coworker’s number through my mom who’s a manager, texted him and haven’t heard anything back. Did I freak him out?"
660,"Geezus..wtf ?.everything great accept. His location seems like somehow he can't go anywhere. He can.meet me at his job. There's no Amtrak or ? Or the drive to from any connection.is So far?
Once I said."" Wait we've been talking /text. For like 24 hours..but now there's no time and fit me into your calendar ?? Huh?? "" so all the I'm looking for someone...? I think he's married or separated.has kids."
661,"Before I begin. My parents both make 5-6 figure incomes per year, we live in NYC, we are not in poverty, but nor are we super-rich. Please at least read the post before saying I'm spoiled. BTW, I'm 15.

Note: Skip this if you want, there will be a TLDR

Here's the thing I have 2 pairs of jeans, and 3 pairs of shorts, 2 hoodies, a jacket, and a winter jacket. And I know, as adults you see this as enough, but let's admit it. I know I'm a teenager and I'm too self-conscious. You also know that. Let's skip that part. So, I was looking at sale hoodies (basically all anyone wears at my school) and thought I should buy a few. But my parents said that I'm entitled, how they've both worn their clothes for years, that I'm still growing, I have enough clothes, etc. Remember that these are 20 dollar hoodies that I'm paying for with my salary (part-time). Their 5-10-year-old clothes are from when they were 30-40, and fit them well, with them having maybe 5-6 coats, 10 hoodies, basically enough that they have to store it in the shed since their closet is full. These are all name brand stuff too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later on in the year, I found some Uniqlo jeans I wanted to buy, and at 10 bucks a pair, I thought ""why not"". Still a hard-no. This time, my jeans literally had BLOOD on them from boxing, and needed to be washed, leaving me with one pair to work with (I live in NY, and it's too cold to wear shorts in September IMO). But no, still the same argument.

&amp;#x200B;

The last straw was tonight. I wanted to go to the store to pick up my FREE Uniqlo heatware. You guessed it. Still a hard no.  My parents have always been like this, and it took me months to get them to let me eat healthy, do boxing, skateboarding, etc. How do I convince them that having at least a bit of variety of clothes, is while I will admit a first-world problem, pretty fucking normal for a high school student?



TLDR: Stubborn Asian parents, won't even let me get free clothes when I do need them, in a sense."
662,"I am sure this may be lame compared to other juicy and salacious things I have seen, but I really need some advice and guidance....

My husband (36M) of nearly 5 years has been texting with an old boss (43F), we will call her Carol. He has admitted to me he is attracted to her, but continues to swear they are only friends. I have no issues with him talking to other women as long as it remains friends.

On Monday of this week I happened to notice a text from him to her telling her that he has a crush on her. I immediately confront him about it and he says he was “just trying to boost her up because she is going through a divorce” and denies he was trying to “fish” for more or to see where it could go. 

To me when you are married you don’t tell anyone but your spouse that you are attracted to them. Am I wrong?"
663,"To make a long story short sons wife cheated on a girls weekend excursion with a guy she did not know 2 nights in a row.  This happened 2 months ago.
I feel there is a history of manipulation in their short 4 year marriage.   They have a 3 year old.  He lives at home prior to him moving out with her.   She could not find a roommate so he was kind enough to step up to the plate when he was not financially ready. They were together only 3 months before he moved out.  Once he moved out they were married within 8 months and had a child after being married 11 months.   He found out she was a stripper during this time from an old phone.   She had old text from clients.   I suppose the content was not to his liking.  She also has a kid from another relationship before my son.   She does not have any custody rights and the father does not like for the kid to see her.  
I saw her for the first time this weekend since her cheating and not a word about her actions and behaved like nothing happened.  Even boasted their love for each other while I think well if this was the case what happened 2 months ago when you were giving sex to another guy.  I don’t like her and I find it hard to be around her.   What is the general sentiment about this out there?"
664,"My(M22) GF(F24) and I are in a long-distance relationship (6 months now). We text quite often and even talk on the phone but she isn't comfortable with sharing pictures (like outfit pictures or selfies) or facetime calls. If I ask to ""see"" her or ask to video chat she always comes up with some excuse as to why she can't or simply says she doesn't want too. It's quite upsetting because I want to be closer in that realm but she refuses to get comfortable with me in that aspect.  


Edit: We have video chatted before (FaceTime, Discord Calls, Zoom Calls, Skype Calls) I just feel like I have to make a grand effort over the course of weeks to even get her to think about showing her face to me. This is odd because she streams on mixer, but when it comes to showing her face to just me and not the entire world it suddenly becomes uncomfortable."
665,"We've been together for 7 years with one break in the middle. My girlfirend's little brother \[7M\] is autistic. As far as I understand it he's barely a high functioning autist with most of his problems being speech related and gets very violent (think pulling hair, biting, kicking). My girlfriend's family says they don't get much help from the government because he isn't a priority, his social worker hasn't even contacted the family since he was 2. It's hard for them to bring him outside because of his tantrums which include super loud screaming, so for the most part he stays home playing on an iPad. The mom in the family has a stressful job and his dad (my girlfriend's stepdad) has anger issues and screams repeated insults to him whenever he gets pissed. So basically most of the care taking falls on my girlfriend. Though since we both go to college she lives in her aunt's place during the weekdays and goes home during the weekends. My girlfriend is a pretty emotional person and is constantly sad with all that's going. She has family members who keep telling her that she's super lucky to have a good relationship with me and having good grades and that she has nothing to worry about for her future but she always feels like she's trapped to take care of him for the rest of her life. My gf's mom talked to gf the other day basically saying she can't go travel, can't move out, and basically that her duty is to take care of her brother for pretty much the rest of her life. She called me about 30 minutes ago bawling and essentially saying that she can't do anything and this is her life for the rest of her life. I tried to be positive and tell her that it isn't, that the expectations she's been given isn't any indication to how you should live your life but she just keeps coming back saying that she is and that there isn't anything she can do about it. I ended up repeating the same thing, that she's limiting herself to their expectations by giving in to the idea that she'll only be taking care of her brother. She hung up right away and I've been trying to call to no avail. I'm lost on what to do. I realize that seeing some type of therapy would probably be my best bet but we don't work so it's not really an option. And even if I could bring her, how do I convince her to go?

Btw this is in Montreal, Canada. If there is any knowledge on services that can help please let me know.  


EDIT: I should add that her mom does help take care of her brother whenever she can. It's just that my gf does so much as well."
666,"I’ve been married for less than 6 months and together for over 4 years. We both work, but because of our schedules I’m usually home to cook and clean before she gets home. shortly(3 hours) after dinner we head to bed and last night I had asked for her to pick me out a work shirt since I get up early in the am. I specified a certain shirt I would like and was given a response that I could just get it myself if I’m so picky. My reason for that was because my other shirts have holes in them so I try avoiding those with holes.(no money for new clothes right now). This caused a huge fight because I feel that of all the things I do around the house she could at least be nice enough without complaining and get me a shirt of my choice since the only thing she has to do around the house is laundry once a week. 
I’ve been battling depression for some time now and I’m starting to feel like nothing I ever do is right. Since last night I’ve been deep in my thoughts and haven’t had one good minute today. 
Is it wrong of me to feel this way? 
If I had money for counseling I would seriously consider it."
667,"I’m 19 year old male whose just got out of a pretty shaky relationship with a woman in her 30’s and this has given me some time to reflect. Am I weird for wanting relationships with reversed gender roles? I don’t want to be a typical masculine man who works all day. Even in the bedroom I prefer not to “be on top”. I know this post is very much on the grounds of moral judgement so I’ll try and apply some pleas of advice. I’m not sure if I can make my partner happy, how can I change to fix it?"
668,"I'm sorry this is going to be long. My bf and I have known each other for about 8 years, we are high school sweethearts and everything is really really good. We trust each other a lot and we can unblock each other's phones, one day we were chilling at my home, he took my phone and started looking at my photos (he is totally allowed to do that and does it for fun only when we are together and bored) so I did the same with his phone. When I was going through the camera roll I accidentally touched the erased photos folder (he has a Huawei and the erased photos stay in a folder for a while) and I saw a thumbnail of a nude photo and I just panicked and got out of that folder really quick but didn't know what to do, I didn't say nothing at the moment. Later that day when he was at his house, I ask him in a text about the photo and he explains to me that he is in a gc with some of his friends and they are really ""explicit"" with their dates and I'm really thrown off because my bf is a gc where his friends share photos of girls, pretty sure, in a non consensual way. He said that he doesn't mind them and just erases the photos but like he is still an accomplice because sharing those photos is a crime, those girls don't deserve to have their trust broken and even what about me? I trust him but suddenly I'm really insecure about my own photos. So I asked my male best friend about it and he was like you don't have to freak out, that's normal in all boys gc and IT'S SO FUCKED UP. But anyways I tried to get over it on my friend advice but it's been months and I can't get over it, what can I do? It doesn't feel right to tell him to leave the gc, because those are still his friends and he technically hasn't done anything wrong. 

TLDR: My bf friends send nude photos of their dates to their gc, he erases them but I'm really uncomfortable with this whole thing."
669,"[What a typo. Slept with a girl, not spelt. Spelling isn’t sexy] 

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I recently matched with a cute girl on tinder who happened to be visiting my city for work. We arranged to go on a date, completely hit it off and ended up going on another a day later. After the second date she came back with me and we had really fantastic sex and she slept at mine. The next evening she came over again and the same happened. Said our goodbyes knowing she’d be flying back to her home and that we’d keep in contact. Since then we’ve been messaging almost every day to some extent.

I requested to follow her insta and she declined which I thought was odd. Did some digging and noticed that a guy has liked a photo of hers. Clicked through and noticed the guy is ‘in a relationship’ with her. Only for a few months let it be known. Few more clicks and I see that a day or two after she’s arrived home she was posting ‘I love you’ etc on his photos of them together. Transpired that her boyfriend lives on another continent and that she’s intending on moving there to be with him for a year or so.

To make matters more complicated, as I said, we really hit it off and I was keen to somehow see more of her. As she’s giving up work (with the intention of soon moving abroad) I suggested we did some travelling before she left (not knowing at the time she was moving to be with her boyfriend). 

I’ve not let on that I know nor do I want to cause her trouble. If I’m honest, I want to see her.  She was really quite special and I know we’d have a blast. At the same time this poor guy is head over heals with a girl who decides to go on tinder and sleep with myself multiple times. Also I now know that she’s not to be trusted. Yet I’m still kinda crushing on her.

What to do reddit?"
670,"I have been dating him for 2 months and he recently introduced me to his best friends. I was expecting a mix of boys and gals. But when his friends opened the door to the apartment (we were invited to a dinner) it was only women.

It were 3 women. All single and might I add beautiful. They were nice made conversation and were silly with him all night. They have known each other for 2 years and formed like a ""family"". Because he has told me that they see each other almost every day. Idk he has some male friends but his best friends are only female. It struck me as odd and is making me kind of uneasy. Is this normal guys?"
671,"So I met this girl a while back which we were talking a lot over Instagram but then at one point she ghosted me. Yes I know but it was because she was shy and nervous(if you don’t believe me don’t). So recently she contacted me again on the gram after a while telling me how much of an asshole she was for leaving me on read and wanted to get to know me again if I wanted to. I gave it a shot but without expectations because why not right? For about a week already, we have been texted each other every single day, not talking all the time but there hasn’t been a day we haven’t talked. I’m not the one that always starts the conversation so that really blows my mind. We have so much in common and have the same feel to explore as shy introverted people. Plus she is beautiful as girl and as a friend so far. I mean it’s too soon to make assumptions through experiences but I think she’s the one like THE one. Obviously I’m gunna wait a while before commuting anything but I have a really good feeling about this girl. At the same time it is hard for me to believe but this is actually real. Would anyone know why it would be difficult for someone to believe in finding the perfect girl? This question may be a waste of time but I like to hear what people think, sorry. Thank you!"
672,"here’s an early tl;dr Got yelled in front of a group of friends I’m weird and creepy and to fix myself. Cried for a bit at home. I don’t know where to start.

I want to preface this by saying this is a relatively new group. I said some pretty weird shit but it’s always come back by them bringing it up. Just weird things since they were actually random. Sentences and phrases you wouldn’t expect. I always thought what I said was funny. I’m starting to think they’re laughing at me and not what I said.

I don’t know if I should see a social coach or therapist about this. I could never keep friends during middle school and high school simply because I was an outcast and many of them knew how to talk amongst themselves. I never did. In order to get some sort of attention I’d say something random that was funny and belonged to the conversation. I guess it stuck with me all this time.

Whenever these people would text me I’d reply fast. Instantly. I really crave interaction. I thought I was introvert this whole time. I’m not. I’d hold a conversation that was normal. 

In group texts, however, things get out of hand and I just spout out something that contributes yet tries to be funny. It hurts knowing that i was actually annoying them. I thought I was being funny. 

Today one of them had it and just yelled into the public how fucking weird I am, I make unnecessary jokes, and how I’ll always be a loner. How I should just leave. I teared up because of how embarrassing it was. I didn’t know I was doing it. 

Now I’m stuck thinking and contemplating what to do now. I don’t know how to fix myself. I thought this whole time I was normal. That they were friendly but not my friends because they never liked me. Maybe I’m not. 

I don’t know anymore. I’m so confused where to start. All I can question is if I wasn’t ever “right” to begin with and what about it is not right."
673,"So this is gonna be kinda long and maybe confusing but I just need to type it out because I've been feeling a little lost.

Background:
Me - 27 Male	
Fi - 27 female. 


FI and I have been together 10 years. We have a mixed history where in the past she has been unfaithful. We have been a bit on a off once or twice but generally we have been alright.


We got engaged last July 2018 and since then things have been going better, i had thought,  until she cheated again with the same person in May 2019. I was shocked and so close to leaving and throwing it all away. I'm not sure why I didn't in that moment but I agreed we would work on things etc. I kinda moved past it and moved on with life. I couldnt image being single or what family and friends etc would say i think.


We have continued to plan our wedding since then and in June we talked about possibility being open as she missed the feeling of being validated by other people. I accepted since it would give me an opportunity as well to experience something different as i had not really had any other partners, even in our off periods.


I downloaded a few apps and passively looked while continuing with always busy life.
In August i matched with Naomi, a 25 year old female. Naomi and I hit it off from the start and I was very upfront about the situation we were in. She was fine with it and understanding. We kinda launched off from a friends first, fun second kinda mentality. I didn't want anything like a hit it and quit it scenario. If i was gonna give it up and go that far with someone else we needed to be at least a bit close.


End of September/start of October we ended up having a few physical encounters and ended up going all the way. It didn't feel wrong or weird or anything but was an exciting feeling and just felt natural, nothing forced. I felt a giddy feeling when i looked into her eyes and it kinda progressed to day dreams of other stuff. I was feeling happier having two people in my life and having a good friend outside of the relationship.


Then we made the decision two weeks ago to no longer talk. It was rough but we did it to stop the possibility of more feelings developing and it being damaging to relationships etc. Since then ive been down and its been hard losing her as someone to chat to throughout the day even though we haven't known each other for heaps of time.


I think the other thing thats surfaced for me if that the event from May has kinda resurfaced as not sitting right. I thought that maybe having an experience with someone else would kinda help move past it since now i haven't missed out on anything but its just kinda left me like feeling a bit why am I hanging around still if theres a possibility i could still be happy with someone else or other people can be interested in me. 


I'm a bit lost as to whether or not to go through the wedding and have constant conflicting feelings. I don't want to hurt or disappoint anyone but at the same time im unsure when or if ill feel better about our relationship. I don't want to spend a lot of money to get married only to get divorced later on. 
Should i see a counselor or something? Really just looking for any direction or advice"
674,"We have been together for over a year now. We go to college together, he is an international student, I am a local, and we started dating shortly after we became roommates. We still live together and have been for the entire relationship. This was my first 'real' relationship, and he's dated around as he's quite a bit older than me. I am starting to question if I should continue being his girlfriend.

We are two very different people. His love language is service and gifts, mine is words and physical affection. He has lots of friends and is super busy. I have none and often want to spend time with him which makes him feel pressured. He's very positive, rational, calm and upbeat. I have anxiety, depression and can be extremely irrational and not chill. For the duration of the relationship we often fight because I feel like he doesn't care about me (isn't showing enough of my love language) and he gets mad because I am not seeing his love language. For a while I tried to understand him better and be more patient. It worked, but I still feel like I'm missing something and feel unfulfilled although I love him and care about him massively. 

Things are feeling very dull and routine. I crave something exciting and meaningful. I am a very sexual, passionate person. He is not. We rarely have sex now, and when we do it lacks the passion I crave. When he kisses me it's always the quickest peck and I always feel left empty and disappointed. I have to ask him when I want to be touched, which kind of defeats the purpose, and he will touch (hug, kiss, etc) as quick as possible to get it over with. This makes me feel like unwanted shit, and even more so because I don't want to pressure him into doing something he doesn't want to do, but I crave it so bad so I am feeling extremely conflicted. 

I feel like we have become more like best friends and roommates that sleep in the same bed and share the grocery bill than boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm sad to say that I've started becoming attracted to another guy sexually. I feel bad that I feel this way, I would never want to hurt my boyfriends feelings, cheat or betray him. But I also feel not the happiest in this relationship. He's going on exchange for like 7-8 months in a couple months, so the contact and communication will lessen even more. He wants to stay together for the whole time. I asked if he wanted to be in an open relationship for that time and it was a stern no. This is my first relationship. He's broken my heart countless times throughout the duration of it already when we fight (we have horrible fights), but I don't want to act too fast or do something stupid. We have a lease together, we see each other every day. But I'm also so young, I don't want to be trapped in a relationship. But I also don't want to be greedy and make a selfish decision and I don't want to hurt his feelings. Basically, what is the right thing to do, and how do I do it?"
675,"Well, I stole a kiss from her. We are really close friends but shit happens, I shouldve asked her out earlier but someone else did. 

However, when she became exclusive with someone, a week after that I told her that I liked her back then. Then poof, she actually like me back then too, and she became conflicted with het feelings. 


Few weeks have passed, her relationship became really toxic to the point shes being forced to staying into that. 

We met during midnight, had a long deep talk with her. I met her mom too, which apparently loves me so much that she prefers me much more than the guy that the girl I like is dating. 

We felt so much connection when I held her hand and when I hugged her. I know she has feelings for me but cant break it off with her current relationship. After saying goodbye because it was alrdy 4am, I stole a kiss from her. She didnt get mad but in fact, she was too flustered, smiling, and laughing. She couldnt believed it. 

I asked her ""You like it didnt you?"". She didnt answer but she was smiling. ""Please be SAFE on your way home. Message me okay?"" 

Those were her last words. We still talked the day after that but, she said she had been feeling guilty. Now shes completely avoiding me. 

Im not really miserable or frustrated. Im not gonna give up on her, shes not being treated right atm by the guy shes dating and hes being toxic. 

But I want to know your insights. What u guys think shes thinking ? What u guys thing bout the situation."
676,"This guy I hang out with always is really flirty when we hang out, but is horrible at texting back and doesn’t really acknowledge me in public. Is he just trying to protect his feelings and not get too vulnerable with me, or is he lonely and opportunistic? 
He’s told me before that in order to make a girl like you, you have to leave her confused about where she stands with you, and what she means to you. I’m in such a predicament- I like this guy a lot but I’m not comfortable throwing myself at people. I like to know where I stand with people, and I’ve made subtle hints that I’m interested, and he has too, but I don’t know if he truly cares about me or if he’s just trying to take advantage of the fact that a girl is showing him affection. Any advice is helpful"
677,"Basically my partner has said that she needs to split up for a while to get herself right (and for me to get right as well) mentally and to have some proper space 
While she wants space and stuff she is lovely and has said anytime I'm really struggling or in an emergency or I just need a shoulder to cry on she's only a call away 
While we were together (1 And a half years) we made a lot of plans together and talked about all kinda stuff like weddings kids holidays etc

I get a long very well with her mum (the only family she has in the country) and she has said I'm welcome to come walk her dog and see him anytime I like (as I said I'd miss him lots lol)

She seems very comfortable and like she really does just need some time to miss me and get back the love we once had 

My only issue is I feel completely lost without her, I don't really have any other friends and I've pretty much spent every day with her for the last year (part of the issue) 
This wasn't by any means out of the blue but I'm defjnilty struggling 

The only advice that might help is how I can not fall into the trap of messaging her constantly and not giving her that space she wants 

Not sure what kind of advice I'm after or if I just wanted to rant but if you have any words of wisdom please leave them below"
678,"Little backstory here, used to talk with my girlfriend when I was away from home on Instagram, I felt like I no longer really wanted to be on Instagram and I could just text her when I was away since she was the only person I would talk to on there, all my friends are on Snapchat, so I proceeded to delete my account, few days later I decided I wanted to see my girlfriends account one last time as I was away for a trip, made a new account, searched her name up and found out she had deleted our pics together and put single in her bio, I was shocked when I first saw it and haven't told her about it, does this mean anything and what should I do?

Edit: Thanks for the comments everyone, I suppose my life takes another path from here on"
679,"Anyone have theories on how growing up with parents that have been cheating on each other since forever, can affect a child as they grow into an adult?"
680,"Hey so I fell in love with this girl a few years ago, we’ve been friends for about 4-5 years and last year we started dating. We dated for 6 months and it was pretty good. 

Last summer, she started getting really distant to the point where she would just be gone for weeks without texting or anything. Eventually I couldn’t take it, so I broke things off with her.

Now she’s been in my friend group for the past 4-5 years and last year, we invited a very toxic person into our group. This toxic person was finally kicked out for her behavior towards one of my best friends. When I broke up with my ex, she told the toxic person all the shit I used to say about toxic person. This made me super pissed, so I blocked her on Snapchat and sms.

Now, my ex has a best friend who is a mutual friend and used to tell me everything that my ex said about me (like how she blushed whenever I called and cute stuff like that). Recently, she called me saying how my ex had an emotional breakdown that day and that she felt like she had to rant to anyone about all her problems but that she really wanted to stay friends with me and stuff. She says that my ex still likes me and every day after school, she talks about how much she loves me and misses me. Which is literally my same dilemma.

I miss her like crazy but I don’t want to pursue a friendship or relationship with someone who would turn around and tell people anything I said y’know? What should I do? I unblocked her yesterday because I felt bad but I still don’t know what to do :/"
681,"In a previous post, I outlined my situation.

Me, 28M, ex wife 36F.

She has medical problems, she is... with as much non-asshole way I can say it- not a supermodel.

She has had many facial surgeries, and is partially blind.

I am awaiting my divorce papers in the mail, and for the past 5 years of marriage she had been extremely self conscious and always “threatened” me with accusations of “finding a brainless blond whore who will put up with the stupid way of going on”

I wanted children with her, but she didn’t want children related to my family, specifically my father who she has a lot of hatred for.

She said in her last commutation that she probably won’t find another husband, and it’s eating me up to honest... I don’t  know how not to blame myself. She has repeatedly told me that I ruined her life, because I never could provide a proper life. I feel like I’m abandoning her, and I’m callous, cold and selfish if I find someone who is willing to be a companion, and build a life with me, not wait for me to have everything turn key for her.

I just don’t know where to start moving forward away from this, and advice would be appreciated,"
682,"So I've been texting my crush lately and we have these really long conversations, she was talking bad about herself , then I told her she is beautiful. She returned the compliment. Then I mustered up the courage to say ""I like u a lot tbh"" then she said ""I like u too :)"" but we've been talking and idk if she means as a friend or she thinks I meant as a friend. I need help please, I dont want to ask cause I'll feel like an idiot."
683,My (M21) girlfriend (F19) has been acting cold/distant the past few days. We normally have regular phone calls on the days we dont see each other. Haven't seen her since the weekend. Now we've only talked very briefly a couple times since. I know she's busy studying and thats what she told me. Should I give her space and wait until she reaches out? Or should I reach out and ask if there's anything on her mind? Thanks for advice in advance. This is my first LTR so I'm new to handling these situations
684,"We’ve been together almost 10 months now and overall I am very happy with my relationship with her and we’ve only been through one hiccup but other then that we’ve been happy for the majority of it. But her self confidence issues are driving me down further and further and I feel like I need to talk to her how I feel. She can’t seem to appreciate herself one bit and is always finding someway to put herself down. I tell her she’s beautiful and other compliments a lot of the time but occasionally get shut down and she says she’s not.

She’s told me very briefly that she is has self confidence issues and I try to support her every chance I get but lately sex issues have made me need to have an open conversation with her.

For the past few months I’ve stopped initiating because whenever I would and she’s not feeling anything she’s not into it. My self confidence has tanked because a lot of the time she tells me to not look while getting dressed or apologizes for being naked in bed with me. I’ve been trying to please her anyway I can but she seems to want to end sex or have a “quickie” instead. She hasn’t gone down on me in 2 months and rejects me giving her oral because she hasn’t shaven. We do have sex once per week but unless she gets to a point where she’s super into it we don’t stray far from that.

I love her and I’m so happy to be with her but this is affecting me too much and I figure I need to be let it heard or else I don’t know what to do anymore


TLDR; Girlfriends self confidence bringing me down and making sex less enjoyable for me and making me self conscious about my performance/appearance"
685,"It was something trivial, about missing food. I told him I didn’t take it, but he insisted some was missing and got pissed at me for lying to him. The next day, I was cleaning out the pantry and found that he has two open packages of the food. I showed him and he still insists that I lied to him. I’m so frustrated because he refuses to admit he was wrong and see that he made a mistake. I’m hurt that he continues to call me a liar when I’ve proven that I didn’t. I’m angry. I’m hurt. I’m annoyed. And moreover, I don’t know what to do. I love this man with all my heart, but he’s on my last nerve with this bull shit"
686,"After a fun night last night, I go see him this afternoon and he said he’s been holding something in for 2 weeks and has to tell me. He said he planned to go buy a engagement ring and had the appointment scheduled, and as the day got closer he couldn’t get himself to do it and had a bunch of thoughts. He claims he needs to find himself and doesn’t want to hurt me and needs to figure himself out and be alone.
We had such an amazing life together and planned so much for our future. He’s such an amazing guy and I don’t want to live without him. 
I’m just so confused and idk what to do. 
How much time do I give him? 
What do I do?"
687,"So recently my bf M(19) hasn't been feeling the best mentally. I have been trying everything I can to let him know that I am there for him. I send him messages every morning and tell him that everything will be ok. I try to talk to him to make him feel better about the situations around him but, I feel that everything I say just makes it worse and that the more I speak the worse I make him feel. I just want him to know that he's not alone and that I am here for him but at this point I feel like I'm failing as a significant other. When he is down, I feel like I can't do anything to help him. I don't know what to do, or how to help him."
688,"Our relationship has been a little rocky lately because of some stuff he brought up from our past and my own past which does not have him involved in my life at all at that point.

Side Note: He didn't like that I had a few boyfriends before him. He has called me a series of degrading names and when he does, then unlike the adult I am, I also call him things back too.

For awhile I had low libido because of our fights (I was also having my doctor try to figure out which meds to put me on because we didn't know if I had anxiety or adhd) and he got even more mad at me and would start even more fights saying we never have sex anymore and that we would never have sex again type of stuff. Mind you we would probably be having sex about once a week at that point or by the time I felt okay to have sex he didn't want to and then my period would strike a few days later and he'd be mad at me. Now for the past 2 weeks my libido is back and we've had sex a few times but the last two times he's had me just give him a bj instead saying it's way more intimate and he's way more into foreplay than sex. Which to each their own I guess, but I have needs too and it feels so unfair. Tonight he kept asking for a bj. Mind you today is my first day on my new meds for ADHD and i worked from 6 am - 10:30 am (I only worked at my part time job today). I also DEEP cleaned the entire place by myself from 11 am - 5 pm so by the time he asked me my meds were wearing off and my exhaustion was setting in. I still really wanted to have sex though and so I asked if we could do some foreplay and then have sex. He got an attitude and said to just forget it and has been ignoring me and going out of his way to avoid me. I later told him the offer is still on the table and he straight up told me that blowjobs are better than having sex and that he didn't want to have sex and it was unfair because I always want to have sex.

Is it bad that I want to have sex and not always have to give him a full out blowjob? I probably give him a blow job about 4 or 6 times a month and his lack of sexual interest in me just makes me not have any enjoyment at all with it anymore."
689," 

TL;TD

My girlfriend with whom i am for three years is completely different than I expected, and i think that we shouldn’t be together but still I’m not sure what to do because i love her. After all i feel bad about thoughts like that because despite all bad things she is lovely, very supportive and she is the best friend of mine. I just can’t erase all these things we made through together.

So I will start from the beginning, it will be short story about few things in the past that refers to my objections. If you want to go to the main thread just skip to second paragraph which is about present problems that i can’t handle anymore alone.

I met my girlfriend through my friend which she is his cousin. After a few months when we first met, we started dating. It was fantastic time, we could walk and talk to each other for hours and we could’t have enough. Me, who was after previous(fatal and short) relationship this was so refreshing and i felt so great with her. We were like created for each other, same favorites films etc. and similar taste of homour. I loved everything in her. After couple of weeks we made it official. Everything was fine until I saw that something changed between us. It may seem funny but she stopped sending me comical pictures or videos with her in the lead role when we were joking about something like we used to do. When i asked her what happend she told me that now when I’m her boyfriend, she is uncomfortable with sending me something like that because i wouldn’t want her anymore. It was kinda strange for me because I always thought that if we are with someone we should trust that person more than before not the other way especially that was one of the things I loved in her.. Going further when I first time entered her room I noticed that the floor was dirty and there were a few spider webs on the furniture with a lot of dust on it. Before that we had always met in my place. She was embarrassed and said that she hasn’t had time to clean up when she noticed that i paid attention to all of these things. I told her it’s ok and it happens sometimes while we are in rush. I think that these words were my biggest mistake because to this day she invites me to her place even if it’s messy. I have impression that she never cleans it. When I reprimand her that she should clean her room from time to time she yelled at me and wouldn't speak anymore saying that it’s her house and I shouldn’t say her what to do for goodbye. Another thing is when we met with her friends to play some board games I joked about something that was related to the game we played then she hit me in the back of the head in front of everyone. I was shocked and I asked her what was that then just ignored that fact because I didn’t want to argue with her while everyone else were there. When I walked her home i told her that if she hit me once again I would break up with her because I’m not her boxing bag. She said sorry and promised me she wouldn’t and happily she didn’t but still when she disagreed with me she were making fun of me using unpleasant words. I was so depressed for few months that I broke up with her. I felt so overwhelmed, I even signed up to a psychologist. After several sessions with a psychologist my condition was better. During this time we still had contact. She couldn’t accept that we broke up but she wasn’t imposing herself, she was supporting me in this hard time. After a month of split we returned to each other. Our relationship was back on track and everything was great until we moved in together because if not now then when?

I've been living with my girlfriend for about a month and a half. We had some ups and downs in our relationship, but in general we were good together. I've seen a few disturbing behaviors in her, but everyone has some flaws. Unfortunately, after three years and the time when we lived together I started to wonder if it was really the one. She is a terrible mess, she doesn't clean after herself, I noticed that she rarely does her laundry, and if she did, she did it by hand but not exactly. She doesn't care about her things at all and when she uses something of mine she doesn't do it with respect either. She never met my friends, and if there was any chance she did something else. She is very ashamed of my parents and she wouldn't be able to talk to them alone. When she's in a bad mood, she can be offended by anything. The last time she came back from lectures later than I did, she expected me to serve her dinner as soon as she came to the apartment I started cooking half an hour before she arrived, and thirty minutes after she got home, she had a hot dish in front of her, but she said she didn't need my mercy and the plate of food was there until the morning. She didn't speak to me and expected me to apologize her. The quiet days lasted for two days despite my attempts to talk.

But on the other hand, she's very lovely, she does little things that really improve my day. I can tell her everything and she will always listen to me and give me an advice when I feel bad. She's my best friend, she's often very understanding when I do something wrong. I think I know everything about her and I don't want to lose her, but it's getting harder and harder for me to stand her swinging moods. I'm also worried about the future because I feel like I see more and more disadvantages than advantages and how different we are from each other and how far we go from each other every day.

All these things described by me are seen from my perspective, I am also not perfect but I feel that being stuck in this relationship can be a mistake. I'm counting on some advice, I don't want to throw away something that lasts a relatively long time in my life. I will answer every question, I really don't know what to do.

Help?"
690,"So me and my girlfriend of 3 months have had such a great relationship so far. Everything is going great and we have had no problems so far. So I knew the guy for a while before I met her and I’ve never liked him. She’s really good friends with him and they haven’t hung out since we’ve started dating as far as I know and remember, but she’s always texting him, even sometimes at the table at a restaurant and in the car and it’s like a punch to the gut everytime I see his name on her phone. Idk if I should worry or just brush it off as no big deal. There’s a party soon and we’re all gonna be there and I really hope he doesn’t go because he’s just a douche and other friends of ours agree. Idk what to do. Should I tell her something? Or am I just being too insecure?"
691,"First time posting here,

Long story short, we (M23 and F24) have been together for almost 6 months. She is a really nice/kind and caring girl. When we started dating, we hung out a lot, went out the two of us together two-three times a week. Everything was going great, moving at the right pace, and we both love each other very much.

Fast forward a few months, we started hanging out together less (just the two of us). Everytime we hang out on the weekends, she brings her best friends with her (everyone I know closely for a long time). I haven't initiated dates with her because I have been busy on the weekdays, and she also hasn't initiated dates for a while. Sometimes, she says she will go out with me the night/day before but frequently bails on the day we are supposed to hang out because she goes out with her best friends instead.

I used to be happy that she hangs out with them often because I cannot really spend 100% of my time with her. But recently, on some of the days, I feel like a time-filler for her whenever her best friends are busy/not available for her. I feel she prioritizes her best friends way more than me even though she meets them everyday. The days i spend with her are me staying over at her place (we live 20 mins from each other), hanging out with her and her best friends, and doing other mundane things together.

Is this usually normal for girls (maybe they have some girl-code I do not know about), or am I not her priority anymore? I also don't know if I should let this go on because I would feel bad if she hangs out with her best friends less often because of me? Am I too clingy?"
692,"She woke up for work, got ready couldn’t find them. 

She started searching everywhere and I was helping. 
When she couldn’t find them she started knocking everything off shelves, breaking vases etc. I yelled at her to stop breaking everything and that it won’t help her find them. She continued them after a bit she started yelling at me that I’m no help etc etc. 

Then she said “imagine losing your keys and having to be at work” 
I always prepare for stuff and never lose my keys I kee them in the same place. So I said 
“I don’t lose mine I keep up with them” 
And I have a part time job right now. Looking for a second. She goes 
“You don’t even go to work” etc etc. it’s fucking rude as hell and I didn’t deserve any of what she said. 

She finally found them then 10m after leaving 
She text me sorry not to mess with a hungry lion. 


Why is my gf so immature to destroy a house with a tantrum? Will this change? She’s 18F. I’m 19F."
693,"I feel as if my story needs a lot of 'back story' but I'll try to avoid it because it will become lengthy.

I've been engaged for 5 years.  I pay my own bills and have my own career and maintain a very nice apartment near my 13 year old, for whom I have shared custody.

My fiance works 3 hours away. HE sold his house and has an apartment there. He pays his own apartment.  We LIVE TOGETHER and go back and forth and by most accounts, spend 75 percent of the time at my apartment.

Recently I wanted to relocate within the building and i needed to do a full new lease application.  It's the rule.  It said anyone over 18 who lives there more than 5-7 days a week must be on the lease. He said no.  Absolutely not.  He will not be on the lease.  He said I was tyring to bully him...force him...I was sick etc etc.  He felt I would somehow leave him someday (knowing that i'm upset that we aren't married yet) and that he will be liable.  I have been paying my own place FOREVER.  I make just as much as he does!

I went through the pain of that fight and also the reality that this doesn't bode well for me....and our marriage.

It was an awful fight.

But NOW his son who is 20 has a girlfriend in the town that my apartment is in.  He (fiance) was initially very upset that i didn't want to hand him the keys to my place so that he (son) and his girlfriend could have full run of the place while I'm at my fiance's apartment. (aka weekends without anyone around...in my luxury apartment) 

His son's gf has a dorm on campus and there is NO reason his son must stay at my place except he wants to shack up with his 18 year old gf at my apartment which is 5k plus a month...

Intially I said no....and SOMEHOW it's changed.  He pressured me into letting them stay here this weekend.  He was very mad that i told him (fiance) that the key would be left with conceirge and his son was the only one who would be let up. I said NO, I don' want him staying with his underage gf overnight at my place.  I don't like it....

And while I am mad about that simply...I'm MORE mad that his father (my fiance) would REFUSE to even have his name on the lease (state and building rules) but I""m supposed to let his SON and his 18 year old gf have the run of it?

I know some will say i'm a prude. Maybe I am?   Please be honest....how would you feel about this?  I'm 24 hours away from this.  I guess I'm just pissed.  I work SO hard for my place and now his son and gf are going to use it and my fiance won't even list his NAME on the lease because he said he doesn't want me to ever see him as someone to help me?"
694,"Okay I'm trying not to sound like a prick about this, so here it goes.

I met my current girlfriend about a year ago. She was a nice, modest, and smart girl. We were introduced by her colleague that knew me. Long story short after we chat a bit over the internet, I found that we clicked on a lot of things. So we met up for dinner and see how things go. Apparently we made a good conversation partner as well. So I've decided to just try to go out with her more and see how things go.

Time flies eventually, and the more I knew her the more I see that she's such a great woman and partner, very caring and loyal to me as her boyfriend. Also she's surprisingly very well-adjusted despite some shortcomings and some bad strokes she has with her family. I said this because I have been with someone who had some daddy issues, and they are usually a bit offbeat about certain things like emotions and decision making. But in her case, if she didn't tell me she doesn't strike me like someone who has some family problems (which is a good thing). Overall I will say that our relationship was one of the most stable that I've ever had so far. No drama, no fuss, only occasional fights, pretty much no major complaints.

BUT...... here's the thing: she's not exactly my type appearance-wise, but I thought to myself, since we have a lot in common, just a mere slight dislike about her appearance from me should not be a big problem. Don't get me wrong she's actually a pretty fit woman, but there's something about her facial features that I didn't personally find attractive, and to this day I still feel the same way as I was the first time I saw her. If that makes me sound like a complete dick, so be it. I want to be as honest as possible because I want to find a genuine solution to this problem. I'm gradually becoming more concerned about this since we are actually getting serious (marriage), all the while I'm worrying about this littlest thing. She does know about this by the way, I've talked about this a few times with her and while she doesn't take it too well (which is understandable), she understands where I'm coming from. But I've promised her that I'm working on this on my end, so that I don't have to feel like complete superficial prick by making such a big fuss out of very small problem while everything else about the relationship is going real great.

TBH, I have been worrying about this since the first time I wanted to get serious with her (I have a very specific taste), but I brushed it off thinking that just a mere slight less physical attraction should not be a problem. Now I'm starting to think that I made a big mistake to ignore that minor thing.

You see, again, I don't want to sound like a superficial prick, but over the years hopping into some relationships I've learned that I just can't be with someone I'm not genuinely attracted to physically. I'm a pretty fit dude as well, and decent looking to according to a lot of friends, so I sometimes thought I shouldn't be that desperate and settle down just because I'm scared of the prospect of not finding anyone to settle down with in the future. I don't know, I'm just so confused right now.

I really really wished that she could be an exception, but apparently it has bothered me so much over the months now that I have began to doubt if it was a good idea keeping a relationship in a petty limbo like this, but then I don't want to throw away a perfectly good relationship just because I don't like the way she looks in general. Can someone lend me a hand or give me some input about this on what should I do?"
695,"So me and my gf have been together for 2 and a half years or so. We have a one and a half year old son together. Things were rocky from the start, we broke up 6 months into our relationship because she found out a had a thing with a co-worker before I knew her, and he got mad and ended it. We got back together and she was pregnant a month after. I always had my doubts, at my friends wedding I got drunk and cried, saying I couldn’t see myself getting married to her. 
Then our son was born and everything was great for a while, then it got worse. She didn’t like my mom, didn’t get along well with a few of my friends. The past 6 months or so I felt less and less attached to her, not even sexually attracted. I wasn’t happy, but I’m not good at staring my feelings so I didn’t say anything and she thought everything was fine. 
I started talking to a co-worker. I liked her and she liked me. My gf found out we were sending inappropriate texts, but never did anything physical, and broke up with me. It got to this point because i was too afraid to share how I feel, I’ve always sucked at that. 
She then gave me the option of trying to work it out or ending it. I was conflicted and didn’t know how to share how I feel, but she was tired of being led on so she made me decide. I said we should just move on and not be romantically involved anymore. 
This is what I wanted, or I thought. Why am I so sad? Why can’t I stop crying? Anybody been through this and got any tips? Idk if I’m sad because I made a mistake or just because I’m sad sometimes ended or am lonely 
(In case you’re wondering she’s very good at still letting me see my son regularly)"
696,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 1/2 months. We met in February 2019 and started a relationship in April 2019. We had both been in previous relationships so it wasn’t new to either of us. Things started out really good, we would hang out quite a bit, and the relationship progressed rather normally and comfortably. He started a new job in May and began grad school in mid September which meant we would have less time to spend together which I understood as I also just began nursing school. We have had our fair share of arguments about stupid things due to miscommunication and the lack of seeing one another. In the past 2 weeks we’ve had 2 rather big arguments which were both of our faults and we have since moved past them and learned from our mistakes and stated we would work on being better partners to each other and better individuals as a whole. I truly love him and he’s genuinely one of the best people I know. I know that he loves me and cares for me. I believe he is the one for me. Now to the issue: I am very afraid he is going to wake up one day and decide that he is tired of me and will break up with me to be with someone better. It’s gotten to the point where I stress myself out so much over made up scenarios that I make myself cry and freak out. I’ve told him my feelings and he has reassured me that he is not the type to just leave me high and dry and that he is very happy with me. I don’t want our fights to cause him to not want to be with me anymore and I’m trying very hard to be better but I can’t shake this feeling and feel very insecure in the relationship. I know this is a “me” problem but I’m not really sure how to handle my feelings and anxiety about the situation? 

TL;DR I am afraid that my boyfriend is going to break up with me due to our arguments."
697,"Hey Reddit! My boyfriend and I played never have I ever when we first started dating and I found out he cheated on a past girlfriend. He regrets it, but I still get sketched out sometimes when he doesn’t text me back or call me when he says he’s going to or tells me he’s working late. We are (semi) long distance, so I don’t wanna be dumb. Insecurities are a bitch. Is the “once a cheater” trope a real thing? I hate feeling like a crazy person..."
698," 

My  ex gf had known before we met that she has a STD (was diagnosed a month  before she met me) she did not tell me upfront. We dated for 4 months  and got really involved into each other. She got me to meet all her  close friends and family as well. Soon got invited to family christmas  from her. Things were going great, we were hanging out, going to  road-trips and really were into each other, talked about future,  marriage, kids and settling down.

Right  before christmas she told she has an std, I got taken back as I trusted  her and we had a talk on it, I did not leave her and understood that  she has been ashamed or whatever, I go and get tested and while waiting  for results she breaks up with me and cancels all christmas plans and  gifts. No discussion and no talks and ghosted me. I got my results back  after 2 weeks and I was positive for the same std. I contact her to tell  this she listens but says not getting back together, when asked the  reason ""she says she got cold feet when the relationship got serious and  freaked out when it became reality. Part of the reason is that her work  friends told her that she was stressed in the last weeks and was not  being herself"" I told her you not disclosing your std status upfront to  your partner you loved was not right and that caused the stress. She is  scared to get back because her friends will judge her to get back with  an ex. She ghosted after that and never responded to my texts and calls.

How should i approach her as she does not respond to my texts and calls? 

1) Talk to her friends directly and ask for closure?

2) Go an talk to her parents and tell them the reality?

3) Confront her directly?

4) Go to cops or courts against her? (I have proof against her) 

Please help me I am feeling helpless and in despair"
699,"Basically, we’ve been good friends even “close” friends you can say and she shows a signs that she might possibly like me. There is one problem, She falling for another guy and that is not me, she’s been talking about him quite often lately and been suffering every time she talks about him. This may sound like i’m in the friendzone but sometimes it feels more than that and she’s been thinking about trying to date him and obviously the other guy is going to say yes. I’m trying to confess to her because i’m being impatient and i just want to tell her my feelings before they ever starting being a couple instead of suffering without telling her how i feel while they’re together.  There’s another problem too.. The guy apparently talks too many girls in our school you could even say he’s verbally a “fuckboi” and i don’t think my crush knows that side of him.. So if they do end up being a couple should i wait it out until they possibly break up and make my move or just say how i feel right now? I think she suspects at least a bit that i like her and i want to believe she’s just doing all of this to make me jealous which obviously that isn’t the case unfortunately.."
700,"My boyfriend's sister gave birth to a baby boy and he died on the day of his birth due to infection.  He doesn't like to share his problems or when he is sad. He didn't told me this for a few days and whenever we met he looked fine and happy. It's been a month and now he has told me. He didn't go to meet his sister as she like in different state and he's got classes here. But now he got off for a week and still he's not going to meet her. I know he's sad because before the birth of the baby he was so excited and couldn't wait to meet his sister and her newborn. 
Apart from this his family is going through financial problems and there's nothing much he can do about it.
I don't know what to do in this situation. I told him to go and spend few days with his sister but he keeps ignoring the topics. Don't talk much and everytime I call him he just hang up on me, every fucking time. We use to talk fine before I knew it but now he just doesn't even want me around.
He doesn't want to meet me ignores my calls.  I don't know, I love him and even the thought of not being with him kills me.
Whatever little we talked he just passes some hate comments on me. Sometimes his hate just gets on my nerves. I know none of it is my fault and he's going through a phase but I just really want to help him out of this."
701,"Tiny bit of backstory, me (25F) and my partner (26M) have been together 5 years. We’ve always been very open and honest with each other regarding everything, whether it be emotional, embarrassing, difficult - everything. His dad is a very closed off person, you could say a very old school dad in the sense of “men don’t show their emotions” kinda guy - I’m scared my partner is turning into him. I have chronic mental heath problems that my partner has known about since before entering in the relationship.


So, for over a year now we’ve been having really bad arguments over the most ridiculous, pathetic, small things. It’s clear we both deal with things differently post-argument, he likes to take some time away from me and then he’s over it and can just resume normality as if nothing happened, but this really troubles me as sometimes he will have done/said something really hurtful and there’s no apology or acknowledgement and makes me feel as though I don’t matter. When I’m in the wrong I will always apologise to him and he accepts it and we move on. I need closure from arguments, I need to know I’ve been heard and have the issue ironed out and then I can resume normality too.
We’ve spoken (and argued) about the way we both need different things in order to move on and resolve our issues, so I suggested a plan which he agreed to.

The plan: after an argument he is to take his time he needs to calm down and feel better, then after he has he will come to me and we will calmly talk about the issue soo get closure too.

However this hasn’t been happening.. he’s been taking the time to cool off then not bringing it back up to me, so I’m just sat carrying around the baggage from the arguments, often questioning who was actually wrong and extremely often I’m convincing myself that it was all my fault (probably due to my mental health conditions) based on the fact he never acknowledges his fault in the argument. I’m really feeling this isn’t fair, I’ve told him how this is affecting my mental health recovery but he has quite a temper when he’s angry and I feel like such a burden. I feel that when I try and calmly bring it up to resolve it (when he’s had his time to cool off) he gets angry with me for starting it up again, even when I mention this is what we both agreed on he just gets angry. I can’t keep doing this, I love him so much but it REALLY is having an impact on my mental health, I’m getting so stressed and upset and angry with myself when I shouldn’t be, but when I’m treated like I’m the only one who’s in the wrong I’m bound to feel like that. I’m having delusions that my therapist thinks is brought on by stress. The arguing has had such an impact that we rarely ever have sex, it’s my fault because I’m genuinely never in the mood (anti psychotic medication, anxiety, self consciousness, arguing, carrying around unresolved issues) hardly makes me in the mood.. but he makes passive aggressive comments all the time, it’s become such a taboo subject. I’m genuinely scared to bring this up to him because I seen to drain the life out of him every time I talk about anything with meaning now.

Edit: forgot to mention a couple of factors."
702," 

I've been dating a boy for about two months now, and he really is the best guy I've dated *by far*. However, coming out of a year and a half relationship that ended badly (he cheated), and a sexual assault over the summer, I'm having major trust issues. My anxiety is at an all time high, but I don't have money to go back to my psychiatrist or to see a therapist. We live together, so we're around each other constantly. Every day I get scared that he's getting tired of me, or that he's going to cheat on me. It's only been getting worse lately, with the climax being me seeing porn open on his phone when he handed it to me to search something. I'm not the most attractive female and I know this, and I also know that **everyone** watches porn, but I can't help but take it personally. I know most of these issues are stemming from my anxiety, past experiences, and insecurities, but I honestly have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose him, but I feel like I'm pushing him away on my own and I don't know how to stop. We've talked about all of this several times, but I'm worried he says the things he says because he feels like he has to.

TL;DR I'm unintentionally pushing my boyfriend away with my worrying about everything, and I don't know how to stop"
703,"So today I finally manned up and asked a girl I like out. I basically just said I liked her and if she wanted to go out, first thing she said was “aww” and then she was like I’ll have to check my schedule and I’m in a weird place with relationships and I was like ok. Cuz that sounds like an excuse for a no. 

But then I was like yo if u don’t want to it’s cool but she was like no no, I’ll let you know, and I was like ok. So I’m not really sure if she wants to cuz she never said she felt the same way but idk"
704,"My girlfriend and I broke up about a week ago. She said she needed time to herself. It happened after a series of arguments we were having about what the other person wasn't doing right in the relationship.

I still love her and I miss her and I feel like she feels the same way about me. How do I go about asking for a second chance? How long should I wait? We occasionally keep in contact but I also want to respect her need for time to herself."
705,"I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now and I've always adored her, and she I for basically the entire relationship. Nonetheless, we have had a few small fights here and there but as far as I know that's normal for relationships, they have small tiffs every once in a while... Well, more recently she's not been texting me with the same amount of interest, like she's seems half into the conversation. I understand that could simply be because we've been together for a while but now it seems like she's upset with me more often then not aswell.  I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into things or if I'm actually doing something wrong and need to work on it. I'm willing to do that because I also understand that there's a give and take in a relationship and I wanna be doing my part.  Also I should mention that we're in a situation were we can only see eachother basically one day a week, which I know isn't terrible. Sometimes I think maybe I do something wrong though, because I'm usually the one who is angering her and on that day we hangout she'll be upset with me. I want to be a good boyfriend, I'm just unsure if I'm trying too hard to make her happy to an extent that it's actually doing the opposite.  Please let me know what you think below."
706,"how do you know when you are ready to have another relationship? i feel like i'm ready but then i get sad because i feel like i never wanna let go even though this is so much more beautiful for me. Have you ever felt sad mainly because you are moving on? and you can feel it? its so weird to think about he was once so close but like a year from now?... hes gonna be a completely different person. 
and i know the new guy will be alot better for me i just feel weird being with someone else bc my ex was my person :/ oh well i guess ill find new people
how do you know when youre actually ready though? Like i feel like im ready and things will be different and better but i jus wanna make sure i dont let any toxic tendencies from my past toxic relationship ever fucking happen ever ever again"
707,"So, I (19 F) SUCK at chemistry. I'm the type of person who definitely *wasn't* made for chemistry. And that's okay. It's not my major, but I do have to take general chemistry. So, obviously, at the start of the semester, I immediately used my university's free tutoring center and got myself a chemistry tutor. Great, right?

Well, yes, it is great, because my chemistry tutor was helping me a lot. I was able to focus and get a lot done with her! Until one day, one of my best friends also got a chemistry tutor. Now we are tutored at the same time in the same room, but by different people- and let me just give it to you straight: I have a FAT crush on her chemistry tutor! Now I cannot focus at all in tutoring LOL.

I've never met him, but he is so cute, and he seems so sweet, and oh my goodness his voice is adorable! And obviously, you can't really like someone if you've never talked to them. Which is why I want to talk to him SO badly! 

This is where you, Reddit, can help me. How do I talk to this man? Here are my limitations:

1.) I get chem tutored from 2-3 and my friend is tutored from 2:30-3:30, meaning I don't walk out with them.

2.) I do not see him at any time of the week besides this 30 minute time period where our chemistry tutoring sessions overlap.

3.) My friend does not talk to him outside of tutoring, so even if I waited for her to get out of her session, she wouldn't walk out with him anyways or talk to him outside of the tutoring room. This also means she has little room to be my wing woman. :/ 

4.) Um, so I've never talked to him, but one day I drank some ginger ale and got a lot of adrenaline and was somehow brave enough to follow him on Instagram, and he DID follow me back. However, of the few people I know who also know him, they have all said he is really shy and quiet and considering that I have essentially no tie to him in real life, I don't think I (or him) would be comfortable with me messaging him.

Okay Reddit, knowing these limitations, how do you think I can meet this guy or, at the very least, talk to him??"
708,"hi, i am a light brown skin, 28 year old woman and i have been with my husband for 12 years now. married for 5 years. i always thought that he was too good looking for me as i didnt feel so great about myself when i was in school. i had to initiate our first hug, first kiss and even first sex even when it was my first too. i loved that he was genuine and didnt want me just for sex like other young boys, as a young girl that was a win win. but now being a wife saying that my husband doesnt want me sexually is not a win win at all.

our relationship is so great, the way we love each other is  like from a notebook movie or something, he is so caring and so gentle and we trust each other and spend every minute when we are not at our job together, can't spend a night without each other. i both love and lust him and have never said no to sex with him or any of his request.


he on the other side used to say no to sex like 90% of the time. we would be in his room in his parents house, on bed, under blanket and when i would lift his shirt to start up something he would stop me and when i pleaded more he used to get mad and turned around. i used to just sit there trying to hold back tears, feeling so insecure and unsatisfied and hurt. you can say i literally masturbated throughout our relationship, still am. 

you might think i am ugly, but i am super popular, i get special treatment wherever i go, even women can't stop complimenting me and guys look at with intimidation, some people say that i could do so much better and that i am way out of my husbands league, others don't say it out of politeness since we are married but there comments or actions sign that way. i have that south american look with preety face and hot legs ( so i have been told ), but my confidence has never left the ground because the only guy i can get touched by and get intimate with is someone i have to beg and plead for doing that. i try so hard to entice him, i have done laser treatment my whole body so i am smooth everywhere (no hair), i take care of my skin and wear make up even at home, i take him perfume shoppinig for me so i can choose the one that he would like on me, i always dress up hot and classy mix, so many girls try to take advice from me to better themselves but i cry to myself in shower and while driving because of the helplessness. 

i am a very open person and i have communicated everything to him openly, he says its just the way he is and we will just have to deal with it. sometimes he says he knows its his fault and he needs to make and effort but then nothing. he doesnt have a single friend who is a girl, and i loved that, he has an awesome personality that all his guy friends cant stop praising him for it, they all say am so lucky because of his genuine character since he never talks about other girls even with them. ( he is not gay ) he doesnt like touching guys either. he is just into his work , watching series and sports.

in the last 3 years he doesnt say no to sex since i keep getting preetier i guess, maybe must 10%, so i shouldn't be complaining but my whole life he has never made me feel like he wants me and is intrested in my body. our sex is like, i initiate it, then he says fine, ask me to lick his nipples then suck him down there and when his thing is finally hard, we do it. he does play with my boobs at times but i can tell in his touch and his look he is doing it because he is suppose to, not out of his own interest in touching them. he always waits for me to cum though. But everyday i am just sitting thinking how it would be when a guy comes to you and touches you, makes you feel numb and weak, gives you the shivers by his hands, says he wants your body instead of frowning when you ask him to do stuff to you or just doing it because i am making hin do it like its work. after i amke his thing hard i ask him to do some foreply on me and everytime he touches me his thing goes soft so i feel scared so i often don't ask for it anymore. you might think its because we have been together so long but its been this way since the beginning.he never touches me waist below and i still have to guide him inside me when we get intimate, every single time. he has gone down on me like 5 times in 12 years that too recently because of my nagging. he calls me preety and beautiful and sexy like 50 times a day and he gives me lots of attention and care but his hands do nothing. my friends suggest i should get out the marriage since i am still young but thats not an option
 he is literally the only guy i am in love with and our life is so comfortable and we have so much memories together. we even have sex like 2-3 times a week. so there is nothing critical for a divorce. but chasing him for sex and longing for a man's touch is starting to be hard to bear. he watches me cry while  i explain my hurt feelings to him and he gets mad and leaves the room, he comes back later again like nothing happened and starts showering me with love, baby love , kisses on forehead and all that. the only time i have felt him wanting to be sexual with me is when i was super mad at him and i told him to stay away from me for 2 days, its like him feeling guilty and being scared of loosing me is his only turn on, but i cant count on that, thats not practical.i know other people have way worse out there, i dont know any relationship thats better than mine , there is cheating and mistrust and ego and all negative things so i feel blessed to have him and yet the longing puts me in tears. i wish i could just turn it off."
709,i dated him for a week and he immediately said i can be his girlfriend now. i don’t understand german guys or all guys in general. but i think german guys are different me coming from the usa. he loves everything about America and that’s why he dated me. but he says he’s not shy but he’s considered a shy guy in america. it’s so difficult to understand him because of the language barrier between us. so we mainly speak english... he doesn’t hold the door for me lol i do it to him and found it weird. he texts me everyday which is annoying and sends me lots of snaps of his daily life.
710,"Me (17m) and my gf (17f) have been together 3 years now. We’ve had sex and everything and had most experiences that others our age haven’t yet, which sometimes makes me feel too old for my age (if that makes sense). I am in love with her but recently I can’t keep my eyes from wondering to other girls who I find attractive, and sometimes I fear that I’ll miss out on so many things that other young adults won’t as they’re not tied down. Is this a normal feeling, or is their something wrong in my relationship making me feel this way?"
711,"Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile

So like the rite says I saw my dad watching porn so he stayed at home today from work and it was just a normal day. But later on he asked help with something on his laptop.

So I came out of my room and I walk over to his computer and he had Minecraft open(he likes to play Minecraft sometimes when he’s bored) And in the top left hand corner you can usually see if they are playing music or a video in the corner it does not show the video but it just showed what you are listening to.

So i see in the top left hand corner “a massive cumshot-“ and for a second there I am just confused. Then I think maybe it is just a music title(he likes rock music and they sometimes have weird names). But then I look right below that and see pornhub and I’m just like nope and I get some water and go back to my room.

I know he did not mean for me to see that. 

So reddit please tell me what to do(ps my mom is with my dad they are not divorced"
712,Hi friends my love story is different love story. I loved a girl who is already in love with someone. I tried my level best to love as much as I can and could finally make her to say that I would be a second choice for her if her boyfriend fails to get the requirements which are being asked by her father. Suddenly the first lover is out from my way and she said I am the only option now. Yeah It may be somewhat different and uneasy but I love her so much that I can't even miss a single chance to stay with her. Even though she is not caring me or not loving me. I showcased my love in every moments. Now the biggest challenge for me is convincing her father who is so stubborn about cast. I am not going to get any help from the girl as she is so afraid of her stubborn father. She even can marry an other guy but can't hurt her father. She even respect him a lot. I and she are about to complete our graduation in two to three months. I have job with 10LPA. I am a fresher. Please help me with the ideas if any
713,Sooo I have a girlfriend and I love her sooo much and she works I go to school and when she mentions male co-workers I get jealous. I don't show my jealousy and I she has all my trust but I have always been a jealous person. I am not controlling or ever let my emotions take over and I hide my emotions well but I feel ugly on the inside for feeling this way is that normal?idk can yall tell me if it is or give advice?🤷🏻‍♂️
714,Hey I need your help people of reddit. I am in a relationship with my best friend. She has been hurt before cause she had a highly toxic relationship and she told me if this ever gets to that point that she’s is cutting me off and will never come back. So I need your help trying to figure out how to avoid being toxic and how to have a strong relationship that will last. If there is any advice you could give us that would be great. I hope you can help...
715,"long story short, we had a nice thing going and then suddenly out of the blue he sort of just dipped. i tried to talk to him about it, but after I texted him today he turned his read receipts on and left me on read.

I’ve typed out one last text to send him for my own personal closure, and it’s making me sad but I know it’s for the best

how do you get over someone who treated you so well, and then left you for no reason? :/"
716,"This is this guy and technically we aren't dating (we've both expressed interest), but some of the things he does I don't think 'just a friend' deserve either. Mostly it's just texting.

For starters he asked me to hang out I accepted, but he never texted back. Today (two days later) he just says he was busy.. uhm okay. Obviously I'm not too happy. He's done other flaky things and is obviously bad at texting back. If we were in a relationship I could not handle that.

Not only that, but he also sounds unapologetic. Usually all his 'apologies' are just ""sorry, (insert excuse)""
I want him to actually work on it, but honestly he hasn't gotten much better. 

So, am I wrong for feeling this way? how should I go about doing this? I want to get these points across: 1. I don't appreciate this 2. I could not have handled this in a relationship. 3. Like actually work in this, please. 

I have a problem of jumping the gun, so here I am asking reddit for help."
717,"some backstory, he cheated on me, lied about why he was breaking up with me, and then immediately started dating the girl he cheated on me with and they are still together. this happened in july. 

as the title says, he literally blocked me on his main instagram account, but is using a separate account that he used to have, to view my instagram stories, and today he voted on one of my instagram polls. the reason i check to see who viewed my story is because i have a crush on my coworker and i wanna see if he looked at it haha. 

but why would my ex block me but still look at my stuff and now make it clear that is using that account to stalk me, like did he not realize i can see who votes for what. could it be he wants to hide it from the new gf? play mind games with me? it’s just super weird tbh 
thank u in advance!!"
718,"First of all, my English is not that great (not my native language ).

A little background story would help here. My mom and dad started dating while they were only 15, at age 19 my mom was pregnant with me. That's when all of this happened, my father had an affair with another woman while my mother was pregnant. Mind you that my mom and dad were practically ""married"" as they are living under one roof. They talked it out, dad stopped seeing the other girl and became a really great father for me and my siblings.

But my mother really never recovered mentally from that, you can say she's traumatized by what happened. Just the fact that she was pregnant on a very young age, combining with the issues of cheating with my father. That is really a burden for anyone.

10 years past, year is 2007 my father went abroad to Saudi Arabia work. Transitioning is really hard for my mom and me, my father was thousands of kilometers away from us. Mom was always anxious and scared that my father will cheat on her, it got to the point that my father should always in direct communication with her. Dad was late in his text, mom will always think he's cheating. Dad talks to a girl, mom always think he's cheating. Dad wakes up late, mom always think he's cheating


Dad always come home twice a year, sometimes they fight over small things, like any marriage. But then they got this really big fights, my father always breaks the dishes when they fight like this. Fights like this are initiated by my mom thinking he's cheating, then my father obviously denies it because he's not cheating. This goes on and on until they are tired from fighting. Good thing is they always fix their problem after their fights. But this is a vicious cycle.

Fast forward to 2013, my dad started working at Singapore which is really close in my country, like only 3 hour flights. And the good thing is same time zones. This is when my mom started this obsession with video calls, my dad should always in communication (video call) with my mom like 24/7 only stopping when my dad is working. She would speculate he's cheating when he overslept, when he goes outside for a long time. My dad of course always denies it, because he's not cheating or doing anything that can harm their marriage. And when my dad receives his paycheck, he takes only a small fraction of money for his daily needs.

After 6 years in Singapore, my dad comes home to our home country. One of his reasons is he's tired of the nagging my mother gives, and the speculations he always receives. This morning, I was awaken by loud shouting and dishes breaking. THEY WERE FIGHTING HARD, REALLY HARD (no physical fights) This fight started when my mother saw my father watching porn, and my dad denies it which is a mistake.

This is where I found out that my mother never really recovered to what happened 22 years ago. I told her to don't dig up the past, I told her to stop thinking that my dad is cheating on her. But she said that her mind always imagine my dad is cheating, that she didn't recovered  to what happened...

Tl:Dr: Mom thinks my dad is cheating on her for 22 years. But he isn't"
719,"My girlfriend \[24F\] and I \[23M\] have been together for 4 months now and we're both about to graduate from uni next month. We've both been planning on moving to another city once we graduated and we were pleasently surprised to find out that we were thinking of the same city. We were even joking about becoming roommates there before we were even dating. 

Whenever people hear about that, we generally get one of two responses: they either encourage us or say that we're rushing it. While four (five by the time it happens) months doesn't sound too long on paper, we've known each other for about 10 years, been good friends for about 7, and have been very close friends for about 2 years, and this is where most of that trust comes from. Most of our mutual friends are also super supportive of our decision. However, as some others have pointed out and thanks to past experiences (both of us spent some time as roommates with our respective exes), we're also aware that living together can raise problems one may not have expected before. Despite all that we're still pretty confident about it though we're also aware that it could be the rose tinted glasses of the honeymoon period.

Are we really rushing it or does it sound like a calculated decision based on trust?

PS. I'm going to bed and am going to respond to any questions in the morning, though I'll try to answer any Qs I get before drifting off"
720,"*TL;DR - the lack of sex in my relationship is causing me a lot of emotional pain and even though he's a good man I think this might be a deal breaker.*

---

4 years ago we fell in love pretty hard and had great sex all the time. Often 5 times a day. After about 6 months together we ended up moving across the state. 

It was a very stressful moving experience and by the time we were settled it never really got any better. We spent a year living together in the middle of no where with not enough money and we fought all the time and barely ever had sex the whole time.

We moved back to the city after a year and we were both excited to get back to how our lives were before. We found an awesome apartment and are back with all of our shared friends and did start having a little bit more sex at first. We were happy again for a minute.

It's been over 2 years since we've been back though and in that time we've had a lot of ups and downs. And once again, our sex life has plummeted. We *maybe* have sex once a month, and when we do, he only lasts for a few minutes (if that, sometimes a minute). And when he cums, barely anything comes out.

He is in poor health as well. Since we've been together, he's gained 50+ pounds. I'm still attracted to him and I still tell him he's handsome and sexy. I still try to touch him and kiss him and make him feel desired (because he is). But he always pushes me away.

We have discovered that we speak different love languages. I am one who needs touch/affection to keep me satisfied. He does not. He just needs communication and a shared sense of humor. I know the latter is important so I try to give him that. I listen to him, we talk about everything, and I laugh with him a lot, when we're not fighting.

But he'll go days without hugging me, days without kissing me (even just a peck), weeks without snuggling and weeks without sex. And when I try to initiate these things, he acts forced, or inconvenienced, or annoyed, or just simply rejects me.

I don't ever get satisfaction. It's really starting to get to me. I feel like I'm in my prime and I also really feel the need to express my feelings for him in the bedroom.

He was out of town a couple of weeks ago. And in the time I had to myself, I fucked an English cucumber. For the first time ever. Felt weird about it at first but whatever. I ended up giving myself a vaginal orgasm (something I'd never really experienced before, I realized) and I even squirted. It was amazing. It really opened my eyes to sexual possibilities I never thought possible.

BEFORE we ever started dating, I had a decent sex life. I've had partners who I would have sex with a couple of times a week and for 15 minutes to an hour or more. I've had what I thought was good sex before. Nothing like that cucumber though....Jesus.

Anyway, few days ago I finally got my boyfriend to spoon me on the couch in the morning before we both had to leave for work. When I say morning, I really mean 11am-1pm. We were watching a documentary. I tried to turn him on. I tried to get him to touch me sexually. He started to run his fingers along my arm and my back, something that he NEVER does, and it REALLY got me going (given the fact that I've been pent up and frisky as hell for a while). Eventually he just stopped so I asked of he could rub me off. He didn't answer. I thought maybe he would start then. He never did. I tried to put his hand down there and his response was ""look I can't rub you off right now."" I went silent. Tears started swelling. I can't take any more rejection. Long story short it led to a fight.

That day at work I planned on leaving. I went straight to my mom's after I clocked out. I was going to stay there and pick up my shit the next day. But he called and begged for me to come home. Said he would give me what I need.

He didn't. Instead he fell asleep and I fell into a silent depression.

The next day we went to a concert together that I bought tickets for as a gift for him a few weeks back. It was a metal show...we saw the Melvins. We took mushrooms and had a great time. When we got home I was so horny I thought I might explode. I seriously thought something would happen since shows like that, especially mixed with psychedelics, go hand in hand with having mad sex later... to me anyway.

When we got home and into bed I tried to come on to him and he was just like ""no. I have to go to bed. I have to wake up super early."" At that point I had had it. I fell silent again. I slowly got up out of bed. Sat there for a minute...he did nothing. So I left the bedroom. Went out to the living room to cry. Wanted to break glass (the mushrooms probably didn't help at that point, admittedly). I ended up drinking rum alone and watching TV until I passed out.

This morning, he slept in an extra 4 hours. Didn't even get up and leave early for work like he said he would. He is a head brewer and he makes his own hours pretty much. When he saw me he noticed that I had mascara smeared all under my eyes; it was quite obvious that I cried myself to sleep on the couch. He said nothing.

He has called me twice tonight. Still not home from work. I know he can sense the melancholy in my voice. He won't address the problem, though I KNOW he knows what it is.

The thing is, THIS is what causes our fights. I have been extremely verbal about my feelings in the matter of sex and affection for the past 2-3 years. I'm so tired of talking about it and fighting about it when nothing ever changes at all. The only compromise that occurs is me compromising on my needs in order to keep the peace.

He is still eating like shit, drinking too much, not taking care of himself, and not doing anything at all to try and help his body or help our sex life together. I try to help by cooking healthy meals. By being healthy for myself so maybe it would influence him. It doesn't. Aside from the occasional good time and psychedelic trip, I mostly stay home and responsible. He always wants to drink beer after beer with his buddies at other breweries. Always. I'm more of an introvert and he's more of an extrovert.

I'm at the point where I'm just done. My tank is empty. The lack of sex and affection in our relationship has taken its toll on me. I feel sad and angry and empty all the time. When I meet a sexy stranger I feel intense desire. I masturbate all the time and I think about my boyfriend maybe 1/3rd of the time or less now.

We're not married and we don't have kids. We share a lot though, between finances, dogs we own, and friends. I want to get married. I want to have kids. I want to do it sooner rather than later. I'll be 30 next July.

Underneath it all, he is a good person. A great person really. He's just letting himself go and letting the relationship go. Letting it become just a boring, ""comfortable"" roommate kind of situation.

I don't know how much more I can take. I don't want to waste my life with a partner who does not satisfy me sexually nor emotionally. But I also feel completely heartbroken at the thought of missing him because he is my best friend.

I don't know what to do."
721,"First off, I'm on mobile. Sorry! 

So I'm 27F. I'm in a long term long distance relationship and recently moved countries (again).

I've always been ""one of the guys"" wherever I went and lived because I usually just feel more relaxed with guys. This has always worked out fine, and everywhere I've lived I made friends in no time. Most off my friends are still male, but never tried anything with me after I told them I'm in a relationship.

Now somehow in the country where I currently am (Western Europe) this seems to be impossible.

I recently picked up a new hobby I always wanted to do, but never had the time or money for. This hobby is very male dominant, but no problems there. During one of the courses I was following I met this guy and we talked and joked for a bit so he asked my number.

As I am looking to make friends I gave it to him and all was fine. We texted a bit about the course and he asked me to meet up with him at the city center. I said sure, but you've gotta know that I'm in a committed relationship so it will be as friends and nothing more. This was fine, and so I went.

At first it was nice but then he tried to convince me that my boyfriend isn't trying enough and is cheating on me because we live in different countries. He even told me my boyfriend probably saw me as his last chance at love (wtf?!) and that's why he is with me. This guy even tried to convince me to break up by saying that if he was with me he would fully commit to me and me only.. 

He has never met or seen my boyfriend, nor has he any idea what he is like and I am very obviously very happy with him. I get that it's hard to understand, but for me and my boyfriend it's good like this for now. No rush, we're just taking everything slow and we both enjoy it that way.

I left feeling incredibly frustrated. This is the third time in a row something like this has happened. I've been living here for 6 months now and made one friend while I used to be bouncing around from party to party wherever I was and never had any issues, let alone anyone try to break me and my partner up by putting doubts in my mind. It just felt so incredibly manipulative, and it is safe to say I won't meet up with this person anymore. 

I'm at a loss. I feel lonely and want to make more friends, but all people here seem to be interested in is getting into my pants. It's making me so sad and I don't understand why they can't accept that I'm just not available in that kind of way. I'm making sure to mention my boyfriend within the first 24 hours of contact to try and avoid this but it just doesn't seem to work. I don't want to introduce myself as: Hey! I'm Cave, nice to meet you - I have a boyfriend. 

Does anyone have advice? Am I doing something wrong, or am I just on a bad luck streak with the people I meet..?"
722,"Obviously, both can coincide. But if we’re talking about them in isolation, which do you choose, and why?

I’m currently in a LTR and I love my bf, but have been on and off over the past two years, and I’ve felt bored for a while now. But, he offers me stability and we’ve discussed marriage, children, and our future together. On the other hand, there’s a guy in my life who I felt an instant connection with and dated briefly during a break up period with current bf. We’ve discussed trying to be together again during my periods of being single, but it’s not for sure that it’d work out. I’ve been in the fence as to what to do, or not do."
723,"This is taking a very heavy toll on me daily. I went to my college's therapy for the whole of last year but it didn't help anything and I ended up feeling worse and losing every single friend I had so I'm not going there again.

Here's the thing. I'm going to get some shit for this but this all started because I was feeling an intense feeling of constant jealousy. Reason being I spent my whole life being the class clown, and that's pretty much how I had friends in high school. And when I joined college, there was a guy in my class who was much, much better at it than I was. Shooting joke after joke after joke and having everyone laughing. Even worse, he would outright insult people. I'm not talking about a playful tease now and then. I mean outright calling people dumb/stupid/lame/poor/etc. and everyone seeming to like it. I remember hearing people getting mad at him because he called them dumb, and then the exact next day laughing at his jokes again. Even a few days ago I was talking to some people in that class and they were talking about how he spent an entire class mocking and insulting a friend of theirs because her clothes were dirty. And the same thing happened again: they still laugh at his jokes and love being around him and everything is fine.

And I don't get it. I honestly don't. This isn't how it plays out in my mind. So I went into therapy and my therapist said ""Okay so maybe if you really want to be funnier, why don't you try to learn from him, and see how far you can go?"". And this time, it played out exactly like I supposed it would. I. LOST. EVERY. SINGLE. FRIEND. I had. Only took about 2-3 jokes. People I've had in my life for over 5 years. They sat down with me one night and basically called me a clown. One of them told me called me out on being evil for trying to bring people down. The other one said our relationship was based in the funny things we did in high school and now that he looked back he saw them as desperation on my part to be funny. So that's how I lost all 6 friends I've had for 5 years in one week.

Why... is this happening? What am I not getting? I confronted that guy once over an insult, and that's how I lost several other people. I wouldn't consider them ""friends"", but classmates I would hang out every once in a while. Lost them all. Most people in my class will outright IGNORE me nowadays. 100%. I'm not saying they will give me 1-word answers or not engage much. They will ignore me completely. They won't answer me or even look at me. People I never did anything to. Again... WHY? What's going on? How can I not feel lost and depressed over this? I don't know what I'm doing wrong, what he's doing right, how to improve, I don't know anything at all. What's happening?!?

That said, I can still be funny and make people laugh, but I don't tend to insult them. I have maybe 4 people in that class/LIFE I get along with and who seem to like me, but that's it, and I never insulted them apart from a playful tease. Is that what I'm doing wrong? Should I insult people or tease people more often? Should I learn to make random jokes more often? I don't even know how to interact with people anymore, I'm doubting all my capabilities in relating with others, because they are clearly not right."
724,"[21 M] [relationship last almost 10 months]

We met and hit it off but she was a little shy and I didn’t wanna rush her so we talked for the first two months. During that time we had winter holiday for school so it wasn’t a big deal since we never saw eachother during that time. We texted and Snapchat all day for months straight. After winter holiday was over we finally started hooking up and hanging out everyday. This last maybe 2 weeks before she told me that she’s having anxiety dreams and saying that the relationship was causing to much stress so we slowed down. 

*It’s important to note that I like to make the girl that I’m talking to feel like she’s the most beautiful girl in the world and I make sure she knows she’s a priority and that I don’t talk to any other girls* (maybe I’m being to smothering)

So this was our downfall this whole “I’m not ready for anything” speech happened about 5 times during the next 8 months and each time we’d agree to go no contact until she was ready and each time within a week she would contact me saying she missed me and then things would go back to normal until the next time. One thing that really stumped our relationship was she sexual assaulted at a party by a former fwb and never told me until 4 months later.

During those months she always acted distant, started hanging with her ex again cause he felt safe, and basically was sabotaging our relationship indirectly. She went on to really want more “guy friends” and would hangout with them more then me until they made a move and then she would get mad even tho after talking to her she never set boundaries. I know y’all are probably like “u can’t let your girl do that” but tbh she’s allowed to hangout with whoever she wants cause I trusted her. 

This went on for a while til I tried to break up with her and she finally told me what happened. To this day I am the only person who knows. So instead of leaving I decided try to help her and basically put our relationship on the back burner. I was there for every phone call at 2am when she’s crying cause she’s remembering that night to trying to just make her feel like she’s not broken and still perfect. This went on for months and I didn’t really mind it. 

Things ended around a week and half ago, she told me that she’s cutting out everyone who had ever wronged her and anyone who was involved in the event including me. I felt gutted cause while I didn’t expect a relationship from her I thought we were at least friends and for her to just throw out everything that happened in the last 10 months was a lot to handle.

Im just looking for advice on what should I have done differently. We aren’t talking at all anymore I just removed her from my social media. She wants to move on with her life and I respect that. 

I can provide more details via pm if you need

Td:Lr - 10 month relationship ended even tho I tried my best to accommodate anything she needed. Want some advice for the future so I don’t mess things up again."
725,"
Me and this friend (G) have been friends for three years. We met in my sophmore year of high school and we hit it off well. We got along great and I felt like we had a good thing. Then comes the sophmore and junior year disasters which led to me and my bff (calling him N) cut off people for talking behind N’s back and saying very nasty things. I also had to cut off a very toxic person (D) and after everything G still wanted to be friends with them which it bothered me, I didn’t say anything because I felt it was rude and controlling. Then this year another thing happened that caused G to not talk to me and N for a week at all. The event regarded was an ex-friend was getting catfishes and I reported it causing G to get upset cause she wanted to talk to her first. I don’t know what the right thing to do was but I knew about that’s things because my dad works at child protective services so I knew I had to act. This was the last straw. G later half apologized to me and N for not acknowledging us as human beings and we forgave her. G is now really close with the ex toxic friends and N is good with her. The problem is that it’s made me realize things G does that bothers me. G never texts or calls me, it always has to come from me, G causes me to stress out over G and do her assignments for her (I stopped recently), G can’t handle any emotional conversation and doesn’t like talking about themselves or their issues. G makes her friends and me compete for who gets to talk to her today, I want to stop being friends with her but I used to have feelings for G ( I never said them to G but N asked indirectly for me and I’m happy with being friends) and it’s heartbreaking to me to stop the friendship even though she barely talks to me and makes me feel insecure and below her. N isn’t good at talking emotionally to others so she just said I’m overreacting. Am I? Should I just try to talk to her ( I’ve tried before but it didn’t go anywhere because she didn’t want to talk about that and how stupid  I for thing something like that). Please help. Thanks"
726,I’m always thinking my girlfriend will cheat on me and when she doesn’t respond back fast enough I’m always thinking in my head she’s ignoring me or is cheating on me. When we don’t talk I get depressed and in a bad mood and don’t feel like doing anything. How Can I make myself be more independent?
727,"My girlfriend(26) and I(26M) have been dating for a little less than a year, and it's been mostly good. We both have addiction in our past, and staying clean and sober was a cornerstone of our relationship from day one. She had a thing for heroin and my Achilles heel is the bottle. When we met she was freshly clean, and I got sober about a month after we met. Our journey has been a binding glue between us, and we grew into the sober life surprisingly well. She had a job when we met, but once she moved in with me and our finances became more intertwined she quit her job, which wasn't an issue since I bring in enough for two people to live comfortably on. She did some administrative tasks from time to time, and is responsible enough with money that I have her full access to my accounts, which she never abused. My work takes me all over the USA, anywhere from a few days to weeks at a time, so naturally she got bored once the initial glow wore off. She decided to go back to work, which also wasn't an issue. Now given that I'm out of town so much, we text and call more than an average couple probably does. I've gotten used to the constant communication and it works well for us. The unexpected variable is that her new job is right next to a bar. She has been known to have a beer or two, which I don't mind. But now it's turned into a situation where we don't talk much when I'm not home, and she has been out of contact for hours after her shifts, only to resurface intoxicated. Now yesterday she tells me that her male friend from work has started joining her for her evening excursions and they seem to be together during her periods of silence. So am I  feeling overly possessive and getting too worked up or is this a clean cut case of total bullshit? As a side note I have yet to confront her about this issue. In my mind this is either the end of our relationship or me being an ass so I don't feel like talking it out applies."
728,"I'm in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend. We are both able to fly out and see eachother every couple weeks, so it isn't terribly difficult.

The thing is though, I've noticed in the snaps she's been sending as of recent, she has definitely gained weight, and she's aware of it. She wants me to be the judge when I see her in person tomorrow, and I'm not sure what to do or say if she has gained weight. She has an eating disorder mindset, where she hates her body and wants to be thinner. She is on the healthy to slightly heavier end of the spectrum, but not fat. 

Ever since moving, she has been without a job, previously she had a pretty active job. She now takes mainly online courses too, so overall her activity has dwindled. Conversely, she's been eating lots of snacks... Kcecream, chocolate, hot Cheetos, the likes. She's been working out, but not nearly enough to counter the junk, which has made her feel sick when she works out.

I don't know how to tell her these things or help because eating disorders are hard to navigate. How can I word things best while still being honest?

I love her, but she's on a scary track and a slippery slope. Her weight has been bumming her out, and I'm afraid if she potentially keeps gaining weight, it will only hurt her mental state more"
729,"So this is a bit of a weird one and shocked me when it happened...

My girlfriend is super sweet and we have a pretty good relationship with each other.. we barely argue or when we do it's very calm..

last night I had a couple of drinks and fell asleep on the couch(which I never do).. my girlfriend came out from the bedroom and put a torch in my face and was asking why?? I told her I simply just fell asleep on the couch(this is true) I had no reason but she didn't like this and hit me on the arm pretty hard with closed fist and told me to go to bed or tell her what's up... it kinda freaked me out and caught me off guard.. 

so I just went to bed and everything seems fine today.. should I be concerned for any reason?? was she just tired? maybe she thought I was hiding something and I'm an asshole??"
730,I called my boyfriend gay as a joke and he got pissed and decided to show me a hidden album he has on his phone that has over 200 nudes from other girls. Including videos of them fingering themselves and he was smiling while showing me.
731,"Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit...ever. I hope to find some good insight about an odd situation i'm in. I'm sorry for the length...I want to explain this as best I can.

   A girl and i became 'friends with benefits' at the beginning of the semester. I'll call her 'X'. I had always been physically attracted to her, but was satisfied with casually hooking up and how things were. She started taking things up a notch..staying over late laying in bed with me, having me send her music from my Spotify account so she can 'learn my taste in music', randomly FaceTimes me sometimes, and told a couple of my friends that i was ""her man"". We have been 'FWB' all semester.

   She dated a guy at my school for 2 years, and cheated on him last semester. I found that out when we first started hanging out. Funny story, she told me I should cut my hair because the guy she cheated on her ex with had long hair, I thought this was extremely unnecessary and an inconsiderate comment.

   One time after we hooked up, she told me she hooked up with someone else a couple days before. We were just laying in bed and she told me, I thought it was weird. I couldn't be mad though, we aren't dating or anything, i just thought it was weird. She told me she was glad I wasn't mad, and that she would be bothered if I was doing other girls. Weird right?

   Another time, she told me we could actually be an exclusive thing if I asked her to hangout more. I had always thought she was attractive, and the more we hung out, maybe I did start to like her. Plus, she had been showing all those signs of interest I stated above for a while. So I  wasn't opposed to testing the waters to see how that would go.

   I knew she was the type of girl to drop hints. So i began thinking that her signs of interest were hints that she was starting to like me. I didn't want to look oblivious and her eventually back out because I wasn't catching on. So, I starting 'matching her energy' and reciprocating some of the things she had been doing to me for a while. Whenever that started, it was suddenly a problem to her. She started being dodgy and was just acting differently towards me out of nowhere. 

   I talked to her in person last Friday. I explained how the things she was doing/saying made it seem like she was gaining interest in me. I told her that I didn't want to be the guy she kept in her pocket anymore, I just had to be honest with her. I was pretty confused. She told me that we cannot hookup anymore because ""there is emotion between us"". Honestly, maybe i did start to like her a little. She had told some of my friends that she actually really liked me, but yet whenever I started matching her energy, she kind of shut down. 

   We agreed to just be friends. I kept conversation to a minimum between us over the weekend, and late Sunday night, she called me. She was locked out of her house and a little drunk from a party she went to earlier. She asked me if she could stay over. I said yes, and picked her up. She was cuddling hard with me and maybe we kissed for a while but that was it. She held my hand as I was driving her to my place. She said 'you're literally the best' and all this. She got sick a couple times and I took care of her all night. I took her home the next morning and didn't really talk to her much the rest of the day.

   Yesterday, she randomly started trying to call me out. Earlier in the semester, i went to hangout with a close friend of mine who is a girl. I guess she (x) found out about it yesterday, but it happened a while ago. She was pretty bothered by it, telling me how it was funny that I told her I didn't want to be the guy in her back pocket, and yet ""i was doing the same thing to her"". Nothing sexual even happened between me &amp; this girl, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway because me and X weren't dating/in an exclusive relationship. She tried telling me a can't make her feel bad for hooking up with another guy because I 'did the same thing to her'. I didn't hookup with anyone, and I was so thrown off by her behavior. I asked her why she was so bothered by it, and she tried making me feel bad saying ""oh i'm just messing with you, I just felt like calling you out"". I haven't talked to her since this conversation yesterday.

   Do I have a reason to be confused? I am pretty lost and anxious/confused over this entire situation. I was satisfied with how things were, and then she started sending me mixed signals like crazy, then shut down. I don't really know what to do, and want to know possible reasons for all this happening. I appreciate everyone who took the time to read through my self-pity on here. I am curious as to what you guys think..."
732,"Nothing as serious as what other people post on here. However, I have a question. I’ve grown extremely close to this girl I met some time ago. We never go a day without texting, and we’ve shared many personal things with each other. We regularly say “I love you”, and call each other hot and stuff like that (not a relationship, kinda complicated). We rarely call each other, but we’ll text all day. The thing is, I only say “I love you” and stuff like that over text. We usually ask before calling the other person, I’ll add. My question is, would it be rude to make an unsolicited call to her, to tell her that I love her? She doesn’t hate phone calls, we talk a lot, but I feel like it would be more heartfelt if I told her with my own voice. Would it come off as creepy if I did this?

Also, I wouldn’t call her like that at night, I’d do it at a reasonable time."
733,"High level: dad is turning 60, we have a strained relationship, he's kind of a dick. Sister wants to celebrate with some kind of trip that will involve flying, hotels, excursions. I don't care to plan or really even participate even though I could afford to. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Grew up in a broken home. Dad cheated on mom (a lot), got addicted to drugs, divorced, when I was 2. He was kinda around until I was 8, when he abandoned us again to move across the country with my (now ex)stepmom. My mom fell into a depression and heavy alcoholism and I had a shitty childhood moving from school to school, never getting to make friends or feel like I belonged anywhere. All things combined I had a rough childhood and currently deal with heavy anxiety, bouts of depression and a lot of resentment and emotion towards my parents. I struggle to make good friends or feel like a good person, I don't feel like anyone really loves me. And I blame my parents for a lot of that, as expected we have a strained relationship. We don't talk a lot but are cordial. I've been pretty successful and own my own home, I let them stay with me when they come into town but don't spend a lot more time with them than I have to. Dad is still pretty self-centered, he can be a decent guy but being around him for more than a day or so triggers me because he just clearly doesn't really care about anyone except himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to forgive/forget. They weren't the worst, they kind of tried in their own shitty way. They are so personally damaged that they can't be good parents and I feel sorry for them. But alll they really talk or think about is themselves, and they superficially try to be parents but it just falls so short for me. Never any real apology or even acknowledgment of what they put us through. I know I'd be happier if I just let it go and moved on and forgave them. But I can't. Yes I'm in therapy and just finally found one that I think will help me move on, but I'm not close to there yet and I struggle every day with the emotional wounds they inflicted on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't give a single fuck about spending money, energy and time on my dad's 60th birthday. He's already so narcissistic, I don't see why we have to reward him with a big birthday celebration. He would never put so much time and energy into celebrating us, never has. I think it's my sister's way of processing - to be the better person, to behave the way she thinks a healthy, happy family would. But it's all fake to me. She said to me that giving is not about reciprocation, which I agree with, but I want to give to people who haven't hurt me so much. Honestly, I can afford it, and I love my sister and I want to make her happy. And I see how it'd be the kind thing to do to make good memories with my dad, he won't be around forever, maybe I'll regret being so bitter when I'm older and he's gone....

&amp;#x200B;

Besides continuing therapy, what the hell should I do here? Should I suck it up and help plan and participate in this birthday? Am I being a big baby? I'll take advice on resolving the greater relationship issues too, but I'd really like some help on a moral compass for what to do in this particular situation."
734,"Okay, I'm not really sure how to ask any of this without feeling terrible about, well, me. So apologies in advance if it gets a bit down at some points randomly. I also don't know a whole lot of subreddits so I hoped this sub would be a close enough bet for this question.

About 7 months ago, I had my legs amputated below the knee following a head on collision on the highway. I have dealt with it as best I can so far but I will say that doesn't mean well. My mental health is at an extreme low and I feel useless and helpless. I feel like I'm just becoming a burden on everyone around me.

I want to learn how to use prosthetics but I'm a long way off, and it just seems so fucking impossible to get anywhere near normal ever again. My workplace has been making efforts to make things a little easier for me and my friends are all treating me like I can't do anything for myself and I hate it, but I don't speak up because I know they're trying to do their best. 

I just feel like I'll never be able to be me again. I don't feel like me, no one treats me like me and I can't do the basic things I just did before like driving and etc. I just feel fucked up and I don't know how to deal with it. How do I stop feeling like this? I don't know if I'll be able to become accustomed to it but I just want to stop going through every day not sure whether I feel annoyed and depressed or selfish and ungrateful. I would be literally eternally grateful for anything that could even maybe help.

As I said, I apologize if this is selfish, stupid or idk. I just felt I needed to get help from someone who doesn't know me and maybe vent some of this. I hope this fits enough to be here. Thank you"
735,"Im not exactly sure how to articulate this but hopefully it makes sense. I’m going through a breakup and this has been on my mind. 

All breakups can be overcome eventually. With enough time, bad feelings fade and no one sits in that deep sadness forever. Even in a beautiful, perfect relationship that broke up due to circumstance. People can separate and find someone else and be just as happy. And even a rocky relationship with two people who really love each other can be reunited, made healthy again, etc. And have the couple saying it was the best decision of their life to try again. 

Yet still, the phrase “the one that got away” exists for a reason. So it’s not as simple as always finding someone better after a relationship ends. Sometimes two people break up and while they get over it emotionally, they always regret not making it work.

Long story short, there is no clear sign. So how do you know what’s worth fighting for versus what isn’t? If it’s not as simple as good relationship= worth it and bad relationship= hopeless. How do you know if you had something special versus not?"
736,"We both are each other’s first relationship and have been dating each other for 2 years now since we were 16. We go to the same university and have separate dorm rooms but I was staying the night at his place. I love him so much and we baby each other so much. I love cuddling with him and he always kisses me before bed.

I got into an argument with him over something silly. He didn’t do anything wrong but I was just in a bad mood. He told me to relax and cheer up. 

Eventually I was mad but didn’t want to go back to my dorm room so I told him many mean things. Things like how we should just break up and how I hate him. I was fully expecting him to kick me out but it was getting late so he turned off the lights and went to sleep. I slept next to him. However he had both pillow and blanket over himself and was essential indirectly telling me to leave. 

It’s really cold here in Canada and I was freezing. I fell asleep quick surprisingly, I’d say in 15 minutes max. I did say mean things to him in bed and called him a horrible person. I went to sleep around 11pm ish and woke up in the middle of the night at 1am. I was covered in a blanket and was on top of a pillow. I was at this point not mad and looked over to thank my boyfriend and share the blanket with him, however he wasn’t there. 

So I nervously got up and started crying and panicking thinking he may have left his own house and did something to himself, because I said really mean things. (He’s not depressed or suicidal so no idea why I thought that). I had lots of tears in my cheeks and I ran to the door to find him. But he quickly stopped me and hugged me and then I realized that he was sleeping on the floor the whole time. 

I felt terrible because his body was so cold, like a ice cube I kid you not. So I started crying even more and we both started apologizing to each other. I quickly took his hand and brought him back to the bed and we cuddled under the blanket the whole night. 

How can I make it up to him. He didn’t need to do all that after I was so rude to him, and in his own place too. 

TLDR

Was really mean to my boyfriend. Instead he gave me a blanket and left to sleep on the floor when it was my fault. How do I make it up to him."
737,"He came over last Friday after flaking on a trip with friends he invited me to because he got overwhelmed with work. He doesn't usually complain about work things bc he's always been very humble about his amazing job and how hard he worked to get there. But he full-on ranted about how frustrated he was about his job (he's the youngest in his position that they created for him and gave no direction for) he's on his own for all of it and it's very busy so almost no one has time to help him with his questions. Basically he has a lot on his plate fresh out of college and his first job and its been slowly eating away at him.

So after all of the ranting, he tells me that he doesn't think he should be with me...We've been with each other for 5 years and have gone through ldr across the country, moves, money problems... I knew things had been rough but he just came clean and told me he just doesn't love himself at this point and that means as long as we're together he'll feel guilty for not giving me what I deserve in a relationship. I know that I should be with someone who gives me the best I get that... but it feels like he just doesn't want me to see him fail.

Am I being stubborn and naive to think he loves me and is afraid? Or should I just accept that this is it and move on with my life?"
738,"So like the title says, my girlfriend recently turned 21 a month ago and ever since then she’s been wanting to go out with just her friends every weekend. We used to hangout together throughout the whole weekend before that. She doesn’t invite me to go with her as it’s always a “girl’s night”. And I’ll be honest, I was a little insecure because I was treated poorly in my last relationship, but I told her that I would work on it and that I trust her. But now I just feel like I’m not being heard since she continues to try and go out every weekend, which is also cutting into our time together on the weekend. I just want to know if I’m being unreasonable or how I should bring this up to her without causing a fight."
739,"So, we’ve been together for almost 2 years and it hasn’t been the smoothest sail. I understand relationships aren’t easy, and I’m not always a joy to be with, but I don’t know how much more I can take. 
I had foot surgery today and instead of staying at our 3rd floor apartment, I opted for staying with my parents to avoid walking up and down stairs since I have other doctors appointments the next two days. 
He tells me that he doesn’t want me staying out for days and gives me major attitude about not being home. I barely ever leave my apartment, I have to be home when he’s home or he gets upset. I cook and take care of all the household chores myself, go to school full time and finally landed a federal job after being unemployed the last year to focus on my health and to find a job I actually wanted to do.
I appreciate him giving me the chance to focus on school and my health, but his controlling attitude and his antisocial behavior towards my parents stresses me out."
740,"I am 25F and he is 25M I have been in a relationship for 4 years now I have 2 boys one from my previous relationship and one from my current one. He has raised my oldest as his own and loves him so much. The problem is between us. He has become abusive towards me, He has hit me, called me names, puts me down. It is horrible and depressing. What made me want to end our relationship is when he put a knife on me. He thinks I am always cheating despite me sharing my location, snapping him,  and calling him.  I am tired and exhausted. Last night he spent 2 hours trying to dig some dirt on me and he found an email from 8 months ago where I sent my co worker a screen shot of a picture  I found online of my ex boyfriend (he was never in our lives he went MIA when my son was born) now he thinks this is solid proof that I do in fact cheat on him. I sent that to her because we got into some deep conversation and she asked me to send it.  He is manipulative, and controlling.  Did I do wrong by doing this? Do I deserve this ? Or was this a chance for me to leave?"

742,"35m with 37fm for 2 years now. My girlfriend is a sales director for a hospitality company. Her job is to entertain her clients and such. Often times she travels for work. I’ve been with her and it for 2 years and love her. Since she got her new job she’s been doing and focusing all her time on work. She gets home late at around 9pm and sometimes 10pm. She comes in hugs, kiss and then goes to sleep. Wakes up and doesn’t eat breakfast, she just leaves. She also complains about her job, boss and doesn’t seem to really like her job. She is also over weight and has no time to workout at all and complains about that too. 

It’s been a bit weird as I’m home from work a bit earlier then she is. Sometimes I get in late as well. But my time is more optimized than hers. It’s just weird sometimes because our sex life is also weird and she’s always tired to get it on. Idk what to do."
743,A good friend of mine has been going through some rough times recently. A lot of the people in her life have abandoned her and her dad is dieing of cancer. She said she is “giving up on people” and has kept to herself for the past couple days barely talking to others.

744,"A month ago I met a boy on tinder. A dating app. We were casual friends for a week or so but the past 2 weeks we became super close. We admitted feelings for each other. We would send heart, lovable messages, it felt like my first love experience.
He asked to hang out for the first time this past weekend. I had to reschedule plans on Saturday and move them to Sunday. He was so cool about it.
He came Sunday and we spent the day cuddling, tickling, kissing, etc. he seemed comfortable.
He would ask if I felt appreciated. He asked if I was okay. He told me he wasn't just here for certain things and really wanted to see me.

We did make out a bunch but didn't get too physical or anything. Just a bunch of inappropriate touching outside of clothing.

Ever since then, he's seemed distant.
I asked him the day after if I was too much and if he felt okay. He told me he was comfortable with everything and it felt right. He told me I knew how to make him feel right and make him laugh.

Ever since then he just leaves me on read, gives short answers, etc.
I'm so lost. I've asked if he was okay a lot and eventually he went ""if i wasn't I'd tell you"".

I want to back off and see if he will come back around but yet again, I don't want to get too distant to where I drive him away.
I'm hurting so much

What should I do?"
745,"I'm in love with someone 13 years older than me,
she's been dating someone for a year,
she's 28,
and she's my teacher.
Is there any hope for me? At all? Just asking for general advice, and don't be to harsh, please.

Edit: I should've been more clear, in three years, I'd be an idiot to consider the possibility before then. Thanks."
746,"[sorry if its long and for the bad english] 
My girlfriend and i were dating for 8 months. She is the only girl I’ve ever dated so the whole “meeting family” experience is new to me. I’m super introverted and overthink things way too much which makes everything i do or say sometimes awkward which makes me overthink things even more and i guess its always hard for me to choose the best option.

I’ve met her dad a handful of times so i do know him but its still nerve racking for me to start a lot of conversation which is a fuck up in it of itself. He isn’t intimidating at all and is actually super nice, we’re even alike in some ways, its just I cant bring myself to do it.

We had met up the day before his birthday(it was unrelated to his b-day) and he was joking about how since he was getting older he wanted to change his birthday to be 3 days after his actual birthday and would just joke about it a lot. My girlfriend had told me to wish him a happy birthday on his actual birthday but me overthink it and the stress of having so much to do on sundays, the day of his b-day(i travel home on the weekends from college, so i had laundry to be done, needing to get to my apartment on time, having to give a ride to my roommate, making sure i didnt forget anything, tests i was all day studying for, essays i had to finish. I actually had a pretty full week from college work and was stressed about it plus me just being super awkward about texting him or calling him) after i got to my apartment i just fell asleep and forgot to do it. I still thought i would have an even better and funnier opportunity to do it on Wednesday and granting his wish of him wanting his birthday to be 3 days later. The day after his birthday my girlfriend asked me if i had wished him a happy birthday and i said no and explained why, she freaked out on me and broke up with me and wasn’t listening to anything i had to say. So i quickly sent him a message apologizing, hoping he would understand since i had mentioned how busy my week was going to be during the dinner, and wished him a happy birthday. 

So i tell my girlfriend i apologized and sent him a message through facebook because i dont have his number and she tells me his messenger doesnt even work. That makes me mad because thats where i wouldve sent a message originally so she broke up with me for a message he wouldnt have seen plus on top of that a message that couldve been saved for Wednesday and make it more funny and special for him. But she doesnt want to listen to that either shes just mad i didnt do it.  I also pointed out that she didnt call or text my mom for her birthday even though she knows my mom slightly better and i didnt make a big deal or put so much pressure on her to do it because she kind of has the same situation because she knows my mom but is also just very nervous around her and towards her, but still doesn’t understand how hard it would be for me.
[sorry if its all over the place or things are unclear. Its a complicated story and im freaking out thinking on what can be done]

I admit that i fucked up but am I overreacting for thinking this a ridiculous reason to break up given the context? Is she overreacting? Should i just let it be? Is there anyway i can apologize or make up for it?

TL;DR: My girlfriend broke up with me because i didn’t text or call her dad for his birthday even though she knows Im extremely introverted and find it hard to initiate any form of conversation specially out of the blue sending him a message or calling him."
747,"Hi everybody! Recently I (16M) went to my school's homecoming even though I didn't have a date. I had planned on asking my crush to dance but well get to that. So the dance starts and this DJ doesn't play any slow songs until the end, when I do find my crush shes dancing with someone else. After that, I've been in a constant rut just constantly thinking about it. I can't tell her how I feel because I still have another year with her and it would be awkward if she didn't feel the same. I havent told her or the guy that I saw anything and im still keeping contact with her, but it just seems like im doing it all wrong? any help would be appreciated."
748,"This is really odd behavior to me and I'm not sure what I should do about it.

My girlfriend has basically several times told me about a gift she got me, but she never gives them to me and I never see them. I've never asked her for anything and I'm not the type of person that gives a lot of gifts for someone outside of special occasions. This has happened 3 times now and it's starting to bother me a bit.

The first one was a shirt she said she bought me. Never got the shirt, never saw the shirt despite me asking about it a couple of times and her saying she would bring it the next time I saw her and never bringing it. It kind of became a joke where I would bring it up and we'd laugh, but I still never got the shirt. Wasn't a big deal to me so I just let it go.

2nd gift was a very large Christmas gift she said she got me, and wanted to tell me about it since it was going to arrive after Christmas. I expressed a lot of excitement about it, and she seemed excited that I was excited. Said it was being shipped and that she would bring it to me in a couple of weeks and was telling me since it was going to arrive after Christmas. Again, never got the gift, and never heard about it again. Because this one was considerably more expensive, I didn't feel comfortable bringing it up and asking about it. 

The last time it happened was just over this weekend. She said she bought me a little collectible thing for my apartment and not to buy it for myself when I was about to, but same thing is happening...I've seen her since then, no gift, and no mention of it anymore. 

At this point I'm not sure what to do. Like I mentioned, I've never asked her for anything and typically when I want something I just buy it for myself. All of these ""gifts"" are actions that are 100% coming from her unprovoked by me. It's really odd to me, and I want to bring it up to her because I suspect that maybe there's some kind of insecurity going on, but I don't want to jump to a conclusion on that and I don't want to start a fight.

tl;dr: GF says she got me a gift unprovoked and for no reason, talks about it once or twice, gift never materializes."
749,"My(18) Boyfriend(18) says I'm manipulative and that I dont care about him.

He calls me every name under the book and even with me apologizing for going to bed early, not texting him for half an hour, and apparently starting fights (he will text me mad about something and I'll try to apologize) it's never good enough. I havent been mad at him in a long time but somehow I ruin his day everyday which makes him upset at me. He texted me out of the blue today very angry saying that I still owe his dad 20$ so I texted his dad back saying that I am very sorry and that I'll get the money for him today to which his dad said was totally fine and not to worry about it. Then maybe 10 mins later my boyfriend texted me back saying that I'm stealing from him and his dad. I dont really know how to deal with fighting with him because it seems no matter what I do he'll still be upset with me. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

750,"Here's the fast and brash details. I recently quit my career, and she recently started one. We swapped roles, I am now the stay at home parent while in college.

 About a week and a half ago i look at her phone, see her talking to somebody that was an old fling through FB messenger. Thought nothing of it but then i noticed there were gaps in the conversation, she deleted messeges.

Yesterday i looked at her phone and the following i saw on there from one of her new coworkers. A message from him on FB saying ""I cant stop thinking about those pictures."" (Any other messages had been deleted. Checked today and the whole conversation was deleted). And phone call logs for about 5 days, each had multiple calls around the same time.

754,"I have been lurking on here for a few months, this is my first post that I have been debating for a few weeks now. I will try to keep it short but please read if you can.

My bf and I have been together 4 years. He is the best person by far that I have dated, and most of the time treats me very well. He has been living with me and raising my son with me for basically the entirety of our relationship and my son loves him and calls him Dad.

We have had some relationship issues in the past, but we mostly worked through them. Biggest issues were him lying about hanging out with his ex (who he offered to cut contact with and did) and being cruel/sometimes laughing at me when I cry. He has handled my insecurities well from my previous relationship where I was cheated on quite a bit and sexually assaulted.

We decided to have a baby of our own, and after some devastating losses, and almost losing this current pregnancy, we have finally been successful. I am 9 months and due to give birth any day now. He constantly told me he would be super supportive of me during this because he knows that was not how it was with my ex when I was pregnant with my first son.

But then some things happened. This pregnancy has been really difficult, and having sex is something I am rarely able or up to doing. I feel really bad about this because I told him during my first pregnancy I always wanted to have sex but lived on my own and had a bad relationship with my son's bio dad. I basically made him think he would be getting lots of extra sex but it has been the complete opposite. The drive is there for me, but my body is struggling just to get by. He started getting pushier about sex. If I said no, he would keep asking and trying until I gave in. It has escalated and there have been four times now that I have clearly said no, but didn't fight him, where he did it anyways. 

The last time was the worst and I finally told him I could press charges against him and that if he tried it again he would have to be ready to fight a pregnant woman because I would defend myself. He said ""yeah, kick me in the balls, punch me in the face, whatever you gotta do"". and I couldn't believe it. I told him I didn't need his permission to defend myself, I was just letting him know that's what would happen if he tried it again. This issue has gotten better since then and if he does ask for sex he makes sure he has complete consent/listens when I say no. It's just hard to get over especially since he knows I was raped by my ex. How could he do that to me?

Another big issue I can't get over happened a few months back. I had a bladder infection for weeks that would not go away and was getting worse. I researched online and saw that with preggo ladies it can turn into serious health problems, including sepsis, which can be fatal or debilitating for life. I told him I wanted to go to the Dr. the next day because of that. He was using my car at the time because his had been repossessed from non-payment. When he came home from work he told me he was going to a friend's house to play video games. I reminded him about the Dr. but he said it could wait. I started to argue, but my son (5M) was out playing in the living room and could hear us. I started to cry and he left. My son came into my room after and he was crying too and he said ""I'm sorry dad did that to you"" and it was heartbreaking and I felt so guilty he witnessed that. I had to be hospitalized for 3 days very soon after that due to some of the other health issues I've had during this pregnancy and they treated the bladder infection for me then.

Finally, just a few weeks back, I found out he has been lying to me about a major issue from early in our relationship for almost the entire time we have been together. Not only that, but he would randomly bring the issue up and talk about how much healthier he feels mentally since he made the change. The lengths he went to to cover up the fact that he didn't are mind boggling to me, I feel like I have never really known the real him. I don't know what to do because I couldn't leave right now, I have become dirt poor because of barely being able to work with my health issues. He completely supports my son and me financially right now.

One of my greatest fears has been being a single mom with kids from different dad's, and now I don't know if that's my future. I really love him and felt so lucky to have found him and thought I was safe and secure in a much better life than I had previously. I am so lost and hurt and I cry constantly during a time I am supposed to be so happy to have this baby. What would you do if you were in my position?

Tl;dr: Since becoming pregnant my bf has done things to me that I don't know if I can forgive, but I am unable to support myself even if I wanted to leave. What would you do?"

So, about four or five years ago, my mother married my step father. At first things were great, he was very kind and chill to our family. He took us places and he bought us things, and he still does. He puts a roof over our heads and feeds us.

But then things started to change. About a year into their marriage, he started becoming very rude because he was under a lot of stress at the time. But when things evened out, he was still very angry to us and rude to us. He doesn't respect women, therefore he doesn't respect me, my mother, or my sister. I'm what he would consider ""a lazy teenager"" because sometimes I forget to take out the trash and don't do the dishes or sometimes my room is a little messy -- it's what a lot of teenagers are like. But he gets very very angry when these things happen. He gets so mad that he threatens to hit me if it happens again. Or he'll ""make me sleep outside"" if my room is ever messy again. He doesn't carry out on his actions because I think he's afraid to, but he threatens it so much that I'm essentially used to whenever I do some small thing wrong, he will threaten to hit me if I do it again. He tells me I'm going to be just like my father if I stay on the same path even though I'm a good kid and I don't drink or do drugs or party. Every time I pick up my phone in front of him he demands to know who I'm texting and tells me to put my phone up immediately.

And that's not the end of it -- there's so many other small things he does. Never praises me for anything good I do. I'm very academic and arts oriented and he never praises me on like a high grade or achievement or anything like that, but my sister is very sports oriented and he praises her constantly for how she plays in softball. He rarely threatens my sister like he threatens me. He makes fun of me constantly and when I get upset about it he just calls me a little snowflake and I need to get over it.

Him, my mother, and I were at a concert about a year and a half ago. We were in the middle of it when I caught him on his phone texting another woman, cheating on my mother. We had known he was doing it, but we caught him there. He and my mother fought and he left us in the city we were in, at 1 AM, it was a pretty big city, and it was about an hour and a half away from the city we live in.

My family took a vacation recently, out of the country. We were at a theme park where he had a public blow up and humiliated me, my mother, and my sister in front of a lot, a lot of people. Threatened to beat the shit out of me if I defended my mother. Made all three of us cry in public and was just screaming at us. Later my mom acted like it didn't even happen and we just carried on with our vacation. If I bring it up she just gets angry with me.

Yesterday I got into a car accident. He shows up on the scene and does not even ask if I'm okay. He just berates me for how much this is going to cost me. How much I'm going to owe him to fix my car. And when a friend calls to ask if I was okay, he just screams at me to get off my phone.

TL;DR: My stepdad constantly threatens to beat me, makes fun of me, has cheated on my mother and left us an hour away from our home in the middle of the night, and publicly threatened to beat the shit out of me if I defended my mother in an argument.

There are so so so many other instances. If I need to provide more information I will. I have no idea where to go in my life right now mentally because it really sucks and I've got depression, anxiety, and bad paranoia because of him and the way my mother denies everything. I've seen a therapist but nothing has helped much. I don't know what to do. Any feedback at all is really appreciated. Thank you."
756,"First thing is first, we have a beautiful, healthy, one year old daughter together who we love and adore. Our daughter brought us closer than we could have ever imagined. The time she and I share with our daughter always out weighs any negative feelings we have towards each other. However, it also makes the relationship we have more complicated. 

My girlfriend and I had been together for 4 years and knew each other for 7. We have loved, fought, and built a life for ourselves, but ultimately, for her, the feelings over the past 6-8 months have subsided and caused a rift between us. I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t been fully connected at all times in those past 6-8 months. I’m not telling you this to make excuses, but to shed some light on why the disconnect could have happened. ... I’m in my second year of graduate school in which I will graduate in May, 2020. My daughter was born the day before I stated graduate school and ever since it has been full force ahead for me. 

My girlfriend works at one of the biggest retail companies in the world and has a not-so-consistent schedule. So many weekends I’m off studying, she’s at work and vice/versa. She supports us, works 40+ hours a week to put a roof over our head, and is one of the greatest friends you could ever ask for. It’s an honor to have her by your side. 

Over the course of these past 6-8 months, we had long talks, bout tried to focus on each other, but it just was never at the same time. I’d try for awhile and she’s be busy gaining her life back outside of work and being a mom, then she’d try and I’d be caught up in school and being a dad. 

Overall, the first year of being parents strained our relationship. Now, we have decided to split (ultimately her decision), but mutually in order to save the relationship we have for our daughter. We do not want to hate each other. I still love her with all my heart, but I do understand the most important things is being the best version of ourselves for our daughter. 

We have decided to set boundaries such as: so affection, not daring other people yet, sitting down and talking once a week for an hour about our lives and feelings, and setting Sunday’s aside to spend time as a family. 

The advice I’m seeking is: 

If you’ve been in this situation, what are some tips that helped you both?

We still have six months left together, do we just stop worrying about a relationship and focus on being a family?

How do we live together, in a healthy, respectful manner while not sacrificing our happiness for each other?

Thanks for any advice. This is just a speed bump in life, I know, but as our maturity grows, I want our family to grow with it."
757,"My girlfriend said she had interest and was attracted to 2 other people, who were very close friends of ours at the time because I was insecure back then. This is honestly painful for me, but maybe I’m just overreacting. 
It was 3 years ago, and we were both teenagers."
758,"I'm in love with an amazing girl. She's one of the best people I've ever met and we're friends, kinda- we've been for mere months, but it's getting stronger. I absolutely adore her, and at first I thought there's no way I'm letting this one slide, but recently I came to know that she's into another guy, who looks much much better.
To make things worse, she also shows no signs of being interested in me. As a friend, sure, but not at all into me. 
My question, if you'd be as kind as to help me, is how do I tell her. We're both in the army, and we're about to go through infantry sergeant course together, so I have to tell her sooner or later. The thing is, I have no idea how. Do I specify that I know we have no chance? Do I say that I used to like her? Do I full-on confess everything I feel, even though I pretty much know her response will devastate me? 

Thank you for helping!

Edit: we're both 19

TL;DR - My crush doesn't seem to like me back and I don't know how to confess or if at all."
759,"So basically heres a quick ""rundown"" of my situation to give you a perspective of what im dealing with here.

Several months ago I decided to move across town, settling into a new neighborhood. I ended up finding a job rather close to where i was living, which is where i first met my SO. 
Shes my boss... Ok, now first things first. I know. I kinda do feel like a ""RollingStone"", but here's the thing.

I am an introvert who has went out of my way to AVOID social interactions for a good majority of my life and have never really lived so intimately with another person. I really value my alone time and tend to feel happiest when im by myself. To go from blissful solitude to diving headfirst into a commitment of this magnitude his overwhelming to say the least.

I care for this women alot. She's smart, Funny, and completely gorgeous. Now being a women in a position like the one she's in takes a certain disposition of leadership and independence which is very apparently why we often clash heads as she has a hard time separating work from home.
I constantly feel like im ""On the clock"" if that makes sense. 

Im not sure if our age differences play a role but if anyone has advice"
760,"So recently I got myself into a sticky situation, I met this girl and we become really close. She has a boyfriend and I had a girlfriend. We are both aware of it but eventually we got really close and there are many signs that she likes me. And I felt the spark, now her boyfriend got mad and doesn’t like our interaction and pretty much gave her an ultimatum. How can I ask her if she actually likes me? So we can sort this thing out. Staying friends or not.

Update: I did break up with my girlfriend"
761,"Sorry this is such a long read but I literally have had this shit going on for the past 3 years. 

I had a rough past year and though sometimes I feel the urge to scream or let off some steam I do it mostly outside of the apartment.i call them mini breakdowns because they only last a couple minutes. I have never gotten in trouble with the Law and dont have anger issues. more so uncontrollable crying and screaming from anxiety/depression sometimes happen to me and I have learned how to stop it fast throughout the years thanks to therapy and support from my loved ones. Unfortunately this past year hasn't been my best and I uncontrollably broke down around 3/4 times this past year all very far apart from each other.  I know it is an inconvenience to the neighbors and it's not like I'm doing it on purpose to annoy anyone. I have never done anything after hours and all of my breakdowns have been In the morning or day time never at night where I would wake someone up. 

Considering Many people at this apartment complex have also yelled and screamed and broke down. I dont think anything of it unless it's cries from abuse or something that sounds serious.Life happens, people get hurt and anywhere I lived I always heard loud noises to some extent. 

What really infuriated me is that the landlord had called my mom and scolded her on how if we dont keep things down hes going to have to alert the housing department and putting pressure on her. And I know exactly who LOVES to misconstrue this all up. Now I dont really give much attention to a lot of my neighbors but the one right next to me Lets call her HAG has been a thorn in my foot since we've moved in. I'm 100% sure its HAG is the one who contacts the landlord because the landlord flat out told me. I get stared down by most of my neighbors and honestly its starting to get to the point of where I would rather be living with my bf away from here then coming back home.

Neighbors have all the right to call the landlord to complain about noise if it's becoming an issue. I know It dosent justify my yelling and breaking down my door but i have never had a fit last for more than a couple Minutes and it's never ever been close to consecutive.I also want to be clear that I have never ever been rude to any of my neighbors. I always try to say hi to the ones that are more friendly but everyone else I just dont pay much attention to. Also Its not like there is consititent noise coming from my Apartment. My mini breakdowns have been literally the only real noise made by anyone in my family and we are all literally out of the house most of the week working and doing things and only come home at night to rest. 

HAG is also acting weird And being extremely nice to my mom and my brother, always talking to them and offering to help them out, but once she sees me her mood shifts 180.They too can see right through her BS. She becomes distant and give me the dirtiest looks I've ever seen. HAG here has had other problems with me including stopping my car inside near my apartment door that was temporarely blocking her parking spot (I didn't know it was her spot) so I can take out something heavy out from my car. And also smoking outside by my separate Apartment entrance (Which was okayed by the landlord) and my favorite she didn't like that I was drinking beer with one of my friends at the seperate porch of MY apartment space. Everytime we have guest come over and we host a small get together is ALWAYS a problem for her. She would always send her husband out to talk to me since she cant help herself and will/Has end up screaming at me like a lunatic before making herself look stupid. All of this was also reported to the landlord because shes just obsessed with my every move. I know she always stares at me when she has the chance to, and looks at me through her windows. I feel like shes constantly watching my every move and waiting to find some tint reason for attacking me and ratting some exaggerated version to the landlord just to put me in a bad light. Lately I've been avoiding all of this because I'm tired of seeing This annoying ass woman always in my face for the stupidest things and it's becoming very difficult to keep my cool through it all. I dont want to give it to her because she seems like that's exactly what shes trying to make me do all so she can once again call up the landlord and slander me in every way possible. The only real problem here is me constantly trying to keep my cool because no matter what she has done I have never responded in a negative way. I feel like that's what shes expecting of me since she has overheard my anxiety attacks and thinks she can make me feel vulnerable. Why else would someone literally stalk another person's every move and find anyway to throw them under the bus? does any of this make her feel superior? does she excpet me to react in the same verbally violent tone she likes to confront me with? I have talked to my family and my landlord has said she has always been this way. I am at a loss for action cause living at this apartment feels like I'm trying to win at a game of chess. 

TL;DR: Anxiety attacks have been bad this year causing me to cry/scream/punch my door uncontrollably and my Neighbor who already hates me is living on calling the landlord and complaining about me. I try to avoid her but She loves to microscope everything I do and thrives for the most minuscule instances she finds as problems. I am afraid if this keeps happening I will explode on her because I feel like this is what shes pushing for."
762,"Hello reddit! My loving girlfriend (f28) who I’ve been dating for 2 months has terrible hygiene. She knows she has BO so will shower but not very often ..... she also doesn’t use soap to lather and I’ve tried to make it fun for her by joining in and soaping her up myself but she only smells really really fresh when I shower with her.  

She also has really bad dental hygiene and doesn’t brush her teeth everyday, not even flossing or gargling. It’s starting to really turn me off and I’ve stopped being as affectionate because I literally am so grossed out sometimes. She’s  a wonderful wonderful girl and I think I can fall in love with her but it’s so hard when I’m distracted by her smell 

At first I thought it was mental health issues but that doesn’t seem to be the case, I’m very very confused. 

Please help me I don’t want to break up over this and also even if we do, I want her to take care of her hygiene because it’ll be better for her in the long run!!"
763,"So soon me and my partner are going to move to a larger apartment in the same complex ;to accommodate adding her bff(F21+) to our lease. We have already discussed this with leasing office. My question is what kind of rules and topics should we discuss with bff to facilitate this move in. She has a dog and we all blaze. This is gf childhood friend ,and they hang out multiple times a week at our apartment ,and we all spend time together monthly."
764,"Hello everyone. Ill try to keep it short. (English isn't my first language. Hope you understand)

My first longterm girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago. It came out of nowhere for me. She said she didn't love me anymore and I am pretty sure she likes another person. We were together for a long time and I just dont know what to do. I still love her so much and it feels like there is a hole in my chest. 

I cant eat, sleep or do normal activities and there is no one I can talk about this to.  She was not only my first girlfriend, but also my best friend. I feel like I lost everything in the world. My friends keep saying that time will heal this hole but right now I cant that happening anytime soon. 

I have begged her to take me back and she let me down very gently which I appreciate but it doesn't stop the pain.  

Please help me reddit. How can I move on when I still picture us getting back together every single moment. Its so painful."
765,"I’m 25F and have known him since I was 13 years old. (I went to a charter school that was 6-12th grade) and he was a couple grades above me but I always found myself so attracted to him! He was that tall and lean skater kid that was “cool” back in the day. Hahaha. 
Anyway, he was always very thin and in shape. Very sexy!
We started dating a year ago (FINALLY!!!) but recently I’ve noticed he’s put on some pounds... like an obvious gut and fatter in the face... so he’s starting to look different :/
I sound so fucking shallow and I hate it but attraction is super important to me.. I’m finding myself desiring him less and my libido has declined.
This sounds so awful... please don’t judge me lol.
Anyway I’ve already tried offering jogging together or the gym together but it just never happens.
Is there any nice way to tell your partner they’ve gained a few..? And to take care of their body more? 
He doesn’t do anything to take care of himself.
I understand people age and aren’t “perfect” forever, but he’s still young and I want him to be on top of his health and body..

**TL:DR** how do you tell your significant other to lose some weight? (Attraction is VERY important to me) I know this sounds shallow and if you have anything negative to say, don’t say anything because it really doesn’t matter to me lmao. Im looking for a nice way to bring it up to him and that’s that"
766,"I’m 25 (m) she’s 21 (f)

We have been together almost 2 years. 

Sunday afternoon she said she needed time to think if she’s happy. She claims I have done nothing wrong. I asked when she will be back. She said she wasn’t sure if it would be a day, week or month. I asked if we were still together and we would remain loyal and no dating or anything of the sorts. She agreed. She left and I was in agony. I felt like the world was collapsing in. I got a text the next day while I was at work saying she was at the apartment. I rushed home and held her. We get to talking asking about if things have improved. She told me she went to a friends house, and then to a co workers house. (She has no close friends). She got drunk at the co workers house and slept with him. I find out and lose it. We eventually calm down and I say that I’m willing to forgive her and if she’s willing to go to couples therapy. She agreed instantly and we just held each other. 

Today as I woke up and finding some therapy locations she came out and said that she’s still not sure if she’s happy. She said we have (had) a perfect life with perfect pets, location etc. but she’s not happy where she is. I then told her what do we do? After lots of talking she is unsure if she still loves me and wants to take time to think about it. In 2 weeks she’s going to let me know if she still has feelings and if I do. 

Right now I have feelings and want to get back together. But my brain tells me that I shouldn’t do it. I’m scared alone and living with a friend at the moment. Any advice is welcome. 

I’ve never wanted to hurt myself until today and I don’t know how to process it.

EDIT: I understand. This is not something someone would do if they really loved me. I’m going to meet with her tonight and end it. I will reply to each comment to thank or say they were correct. I will update this once the deed is finished. I realize that this isn’t “graceful”. I still stand firm that I wish her no ill will, and hope she has a fulfilling life. It’s just not going to be with me.

EDIT 10/24
It’s over. I apologized that I wasn’t there for her during some difficult times. And she accepted my apology. She said sorry as well. We are going to stay in touch after some time. 
She respects my decision. We are starting to split everything in our former home and I’ll be starting a new life. I miss her so much, but like these comments say, I miss the shadow of her. She’s no longer there. I start some therapy Monday over some of the suicidal and self harm thoughts. I’ll attempt to reply to every comment. Thank you for all the support."
767,"Background:

My girlfriend was very well know and “popular” in highschool. We went to highschool together but never said a word to eachother. Since then she’s done a great job at pushing everybody out of her life except me and our close friends. She has done a good job at making all my friends her friends and that’s all she has. 

She’s the type to get mad at me if I don’t text back within 5 minutes, calls me or FaceTimes me 2-3 times a day (even when I’m at work), and if I don’t answer all hell breaks loose. If we don’t see eachother at least 3-4 times a week she gets super depressed and emotional. All she does is lock herself in her room until I’m available to see her, my free time is nonexistent anymore. I’ve lost all my hobbies and have turned into a robot because of this relationship. 

She has no hobbies and does nothing to help herself out mentally. Her insecurities are not attractive anymore. She complains about being overweight (she’s not) tries on 10+ different outfits and cries while looking in the mirror because she’s “not attractive”. She cries at work (we work together) when things don’t go her way. She cries when I don’t text her back right away. She has the maturity of a 12 year old. 

Needless to say I’m done, I’ve emotionally, mentally, and physically checked out of the relationship. I’m just frozen on ending things. I know she’s going to throw the biggest three year old fit when I do try and break up with her and she won’t let me leave. It’s going to ruin our friend group and she’s going to be a wreck. 

My question here is how should I do it? I know my life is going to change when things are done but I feel like holding onto the relationship just makes everything easier, and doing that is not fair to myself or her so it needs to end. Since we have all the same friends I have had nobody to ask for advice, or have even been able to talk about what we’re dealing with. She’s a whole different person behind closed doors than she is with friends, so I’m also scared that my friends will think of me as an asshole because she seems so innocent and pure. People always tell us they want a relationship like ours when on the inside I’m dying and stressed out everyday. 

She’s told me I’m the only constant in her life and the only thing she has. I’m her everything. If I break up with her, I honestly don’t even know what the outcome will be. Shes impulsive and might end up doing something to hurt herself. 

Reddit, please help me, tell me I’m not crazy and everything will be okay. She’s making me depressed and waking up is the worst part of everyday. I’ve pushed away 7-10 fantastic people in my life because she doesn’t like them, and if I talk to them she cries and tells me I don’t care about her. It’s just a big Highschool drama fest I’m caught up in and I’m done."
768,"I've been playing video games my entire life. My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F) have been together for over 2 years now (friends for much longer) and he is also an avid gamer himself. Our favorite game to play together is LoL and the occasional shooter or co-op game. However, recently he's been very busy with work and school (we are also long distance) so he hasn't been playing as much as he'd like to. That being said, he has told me that he is unhappy that I am playing without him and initially asked me to stop playing as much because he feels left out. I thought it was a bit weird since I don't just play games to spend time with him but for my own enjoyment, but I guess it's understandable since I wouldn't want to feel that way either. We also talk on the phone and discord whenever we can so it's not like I'm neglecting him to play games. Anytime he is able to call me or chat with me I avoid starting up a game or doing anything else so I can dedicate my attention to him whenever he has time. I talked to him about it and expressed my concerns and he gave in, agreeing it wasn't a good idea and that he was fine with me playing games still. But now he's saying he doesn't want me to play with anyone else or ever be in a discord call with anyone but him. He especially emphasized that he didn't want me to play with any guys. Now, I don't know about any other girls who play games, but most of my friends online are males. I also have some girl friends who play games of course, but considering the demographics, I think it makes sense that the majority of people I meet online playing video games are going to be guys. This has also trained me in a way to know how to handle creeps and flirty guys who try hitting on me. 

His request makes me extremely upset and uncomfortable, as he doesn't even want me playing with any of my IRL friends whom I've known for years and he's also met and befriended. It's not even like all I do is talk to other dudes online all day either; I mainly solo queue, but if I ever play games or even feel comfortable enough to voice comm with other people, most of them are people I have known for many years and trust. I've always thought he was the jealous type but this definitely reaffirms this. I think this whole situation is ridiculous but I wanted to hear what other people have to say. I really don't want to break up with him, but I don't think this is healthy nor do I want to give up playing games with friends. Even if it might be a small thing about video games I'm afraid of how far this might eventually go in terms of controlling what I do. It makes me feel paranoid when I get invited to discord calls or receive chats from guy friends because it feels like he'll get mad at me and make me block them (which he has made me do). I don't even know what to tell them when they ask me to play some squad games with them. 

TLDR; My boyfriend doesn't want me to play video games or Discord call with anyone but him, especially other guys."
769,"Me (26M) and my girlfriend (21F) are together for 1 year and 8 months, living together for 8 months. I am on a 3 week trip abroad right now and i am really worried about how my girlfriend treats me. Before i left, everything was pretty good. She is cold, almost never textes first, and what worries me the worst is that she shows no signs of affection or love anymore. She doesn't say any compliments to me, never tells me she loves me first, and i almost have to force her to tell me simple ""love you too"". When i confront her about it she tells me that she doesn't think that love must be shown in words etc. I am scared that our relationship is going to end soon. I know that i sound like a little pussy, but i am in a lot of stress right now and not getting that little support and love from a loved one makes things worse. please tell me, am i being paranoid or is it normal for a partner to abruptly become cold and not interested?"
770,"It's my first semester in my freshman year of college. I am currently in Boston and my girlfriend is four hours away. I come home to visit occasionally when we meet, and everything is magical. When I am in college however, that is where things get very difficult for me. She is a part of the league team and has made many friends, unlike me. I have made good friendships, yet when my girlfriend (of 15 months) is out with friends she never checks messages to update me. Once, she was out for 8 hours without updating me a single time, and it made me really worried. I told her how I felt several times about how it makes me feel like she doesn't care for the relationship anymore, but I know we have such limited time already. I just don't know how to feel better. I love her to death, but I wish she would commit more time to our relationship. I don't know if im just venting, but I would love some advice on anything I could do. Breaking up is really a last resort option that I don't want to think about."
771,"So ever since we started dating six months ago, my girlfriend sometimes makes comments like ""Oh, you think you're so cool!"" or ""You think you're cooler than me"". I thought they were jokes and just start singing the Mike Posner songs. A few days ago my girlfriend actually said ""You think you're better than me""; and it's true, I might subconsciously thinks I'm better than her. My personality has always bordered/crossed between confident and cocky, and most people had no problem with it. However, it is making me think a lot about how that would sometimes make her feel small.

I know she has a lot of good qualities and I have a lot of flaws. I don't wanna go into detail,  but for example, she needs to study her ass off to get good grades. Most of the time, I cram for a few hours and get better grades than her. How do I stop making her feel bad about this or express that I would never treat her like she's lesser than me."
772,"So, I’m a 22 F and the guy I like is 24 M, we have been friends for a while now, since early 2017. He’s cool af, sweet charming, ambitious, and so much more. All the things I want in a guy, he has it! 

Throughout our friendship, he has dropped hints about liking me. He actually hinted to me in mid 2018 that I was the right person but the timing was wrong. So I waited. 

I waited until the end of 2018, I confessed to him that I liked him. He basically said “I don’t want to ruin the friendship and I’m not ready.” The not ready part was a lie cause he used to tell me all the time that he wanted a relationship.


But I was crushed from this news, cause I really liked him. That was in 2018 and I still like him. 

How do I get over him? I feel like my self worth is so low. Why would I like someone who isn’t even remotely interested in me? Why string me along? Why like me this dislike me? Cause someone just give me tips or a new perspective. I’m desperate here 😞

Do you guys think I should try or just cut communication?"
773,"I know this has probably been asked a million times on this subreddit, but I would just like to ask for myself. Yes I’d like to address that I did kind of bring this on myself, I went into who he followed and started  this mess. I saw that like 65% of who he followed were beautiful models who are definitely more curves then I could ever dream of being. I do not want to be controlling, I want him to do his own thing. But I can’t help the nagging jealousy in the back of my brain picking at me. Is it just a fantasy thing for him? Is it a confidence problem with myself that I’d have to fix? I know myself am my own person, and beautiful my own way. It’s just hard. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
774,"Hi, this is my first time posting so sorry if the formatting is confusing/wrong.

So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years now, we met in college and have basically lived together since. My boyfriend went to an all male boarding school and therefore made some very close friendships since he lived with these guys 24/7. He loves his high school friends and they always have a good time rehashing old stories together whenever they meet up every few months. There is one friend in particular however who I cannot stand but I don’t know if I’m being intolerant or what, we’ll call the friend Tom. So admittedly most of the reunions my boyfriend has with his high school friends, are centered around meeting up for the weekend and drinking out of town somewhere. I normally go with him because his friends will usually bring their partners as well. 

So Tom is the kind of guy that can’t handle his liquor. And by that I mean he’ll have a couple beers or shots and be blacked out, which is fine but leads to a lot of awkward interactions when we’re out. A few examples are:
One time we were in Vegas and they have girls that walk around with test tube shots and they normally give them to you in a suggestive way, ie putting the bottom of the tube in their mouth and then tipping the shot into your mouth (if that makes sense). So my boyfriend bought everyone a round and it’s time for Tom’s turn. The girl gives him the shot and he immediately spits it out ON her face and chest. She is rightfully very pissed off and is like “did you really just do that?” And Tom starts yelling at her and saying he didn’t want the shot and it’s her fault he spat it out. Refusing to apologize and eventually security had to make him leave. Now I want to make it clear that my boyfriend told Tom he was buying him a shot, he was not forced into taking one and it was by no means the shot girls fault that he spat a drink on her. My boyfriend apologized to the shot girl and tipped her well in an attempt to reconcile the situation. Oh and this same weekend we were at a crowded club and Tom slapped a complete stranger’s ass and she said “you’re lucky it was my ass you slapped and not someone less forgiving than me or you’d get smacked) and no Tom did not apologize to this girl either. My boyfriend did. 

I have a million more examples of his behavior, like all of us going out to eat and Tom telling the waiter he’s not gonna order anything and instead eats off of everyone’s plate and not offering to pay. Or getting into fist fights when he’s drunk. Or the time we got into a Lyft and made small talk with the driver, asked where he’s from. The driver responds “Palestine, where are you guys from?” And Tom says “Israel” and then laughs. No one else laughed and we told him he was being stupid. And he’s 27 mind you, way too old to be acting like this. 

The last thing that bothers me is that politically we are on opposite spectrums and that’s fine he’s entitled to his opinions, but he’s the kind of guy that brings up politics every 5 minutes (his friends have even called him out on that) even though he knows I don’t agree with him on any issue. He constantly asks me questions like “are you voting for Pocahontas?” (Elizabeth warren) or “we’re gonna have socialism in this country if you get your way” (which isn’t true but whatever). He’s the kind of guy that “watches CNN to see how crazy they are and then goes back to Fox News for some sanity” (his words not mine) 

I know this post is getting long, sorry there’s just been so many instances. So basically my boyfriend wants to invite Tom over for thanksgiving because he’s invited another friend over and doesn’t want Andy to feel left out (my boyfriend and his two friends have shared a lot of thanksgivings in the past) I shared that I would prefer to really minimize my time with Tom because he makes me feel really tense and anxious. I’ve shared these feelings with my boyfriend before after the many instances we’ve had with Tom. I want to have a positive thanksgiving and enjoy the company but I don’t feel that I would be able to if Tom were there. My boyfriend has also said that if he met Tom tomorrow he doesn’t think he would be his friend but that the only reason they are friends now is because of the tight bond from high school and shared memories. I have never asked my boyfriend to cut off any of his friends before, this is the only one that I don’t want in my life. 

So basically I was wondering if I’m being unreasonable in asking my boyfriend to slowly phase this friend out? 

Thank you for reading my novel in advance and thank you for any advice you guys have!"
775,"I have been with this girl since we were in high school. She is the perfect girl for me and now I know that for sure. She is beautiful, kind,funny, adventurous...I could go on. Problem is that about 8 months ago, I broke up with her because I decided I needed to explore more. I essentially became super arrogant and let some new people I met at work (as a photographer) talk me into thinking that I needed to ""experience more"" and ""do hotter"" before I settling down. I am considered a good looking guy and I know a lot of the girls I meet in my field were interested in me. Anyway I started having thoughts about all the experiences I was missing out on and stopped appreciating the wonderful person I was with and broke up with her.

I know I really really hurt her very badly when I broke up with her. I told her that my fomo was the reason I was breaking up with her. She told me that she felt worthless and like I was tossing her away. It honestly broke my heart  and I almost immediately regretted doing it. But I decided I needed to do this and ""experience"". But....I quickly realised that it was pretty unfulfilling to date around and sleep around and that what I had was much much better. The grass was not greener and that I was a massive dickhead. I miss my girlfriend immensely and would absolutely do anything to get her back. 

The problem is I know from out mutual friends that she was really messed up and depressed after I broke up with her but has been getting better and is now doing better. I feel with every fibre in my body that I need her back. But I also know that asking her to get back would likely cause her more confusion and pain and idk, set her back even. But I really really want to be with her. I love her so much. But would it be selfish of me to even ask and possibly cause her more pain and heartache? Some of our mutual friends have said that this would be the case and I should allow her to move on. But I really want to be with her. I would honestly treat her well this time and appreciate her. I really really do love her and want her to be happy and want to be part of the reason for her happiness. 

Should I ask her to get back together?

Tldr- Broke up with my longtime gf cause I wanted to sleep around and hurt her badly. I want to get back together with her but would it be selfish of me to ask her knowing that she has been getting over what happened? Should I give it more time?"
776,"So my new female coworker has been talking to me a bunch and I thought I was being friendly but apparently she took it as flirting. Another co-worker asked me if I liked the new coworker and basically if I asked her out for a drink that she would say yes. I said no, because I like my girlfriend.

Two questions:

1) I was probably going to wait to tell my GF in person since the last time I told a girlfriend I got hit on I handled it poorly or something and she got a little mad.

2) How do I handle a coworker having a crush on me? I don't want to be unnecessarily cold and telling her straight seems harsh."
777,"Hi, I've never really needed to post something like this because I had friends/parents who give me really good advice but recently their advice is getting repetitive or shallow and unhelpful and I need outside opinion from someone who doesn't know me personally.

So basically I met my boyfriend (25M) in August right before school started in a bar in Nashville where I live... which already sounds bad right off the bat. He was extremely good looking and well dressed, approached me when he was drunk. I was stone cold sober because I was in a bad mood from a friendship ending the day before so two of my friends (19F and 21M) that I go to school with took me out to listen to music to cheer me up. When he came up to me with his friend (21M) I assumed they were tourists (true Nashvillians can spot the visitors). So basically he was joking around, picking on me, and I told him to go the fuck away, making excuses like I didn't drink, I was lesbian, the usual. Then he tells me he's in the Army so in my head I was thinking he was some military fuckboy cause I've known a lot of them. He persisted and started being real with me because I think he realized I was not there to bullshit around. I went to the bar with him and he started talking about his family, friendships, his mistakes and how he learned from them. Honestly at that point I was impressed. I didn't share much about myself because I wanted to know if he was legit. During the time we were off talking his friend (21M) told mine (19F) that my boyfriend doesn't date. Meaning he's never seen him take girls out or hook up with anyone. That was confusing. I still don't know what to think. What do you think that means from my boyfriends perspective? I don't want to just be a girl he met in a bar.

After that he took me on a date the next day and it went so well, he comes down here every weekend. He makes the effort. BUT a few things are bothering me. Every time we talk about holidays he mentions going home to see his family but never includes me in it or asks me to go. Does that mean he's not ready for me to meet them? Also, he talks about me cheating on him a lot... anyone who knows me knows my values and morals are extremely high and I would never do that to someone. I've been cheated on and so has he, so is it just a product of what he's been through? He accused me today of flirting with my parents MARRIED neighbor (35M) and I instantly got pissed. Does he think that of me or is it just past shit making him feel insecure? If so, how can I make him feel secure? I'm loving and encouraging but I don't feel adequate. Another problem is that every time something worth talking out pops up, he shuts down. Responding very short or just says he doesn't want to argue. But that cant solve anything can it? Or should I ignore the problems like he does? The past two weekends he's threatened to get his stuff and leave - which triggers me a lot. It's an abusive behavior and I told him absolutely no one threatens me and I WILL not beg him to stay. Is this wrong of me? One other problem is that he's so emotionally cold sometimes that it's confusing... like things that matter to me he just doesn't respond to. I'm worried this is because of his baggage that he doesn't open up about or could be the fucking military bullshit he goes through...?

I'm intelligent and understanding, and I don't ever fly off the handle on him so I'm not sure that he is afraid of upsetting me. he very much wears the pants in our relationship.

OH and the only time he truly opens up is when he's drunk so every weekend we're drunk or he is and talks while I soberly listen... he's never lied about anything so his drunk opening up are all real things in his head.

He reenlisted for another 3 years following his promotion in November and we're moving to Colorado. Our commitment level is serious for a short amount of time which is so steryotypical for military relationships, I kinda hate it. But I've told him I'm all in because I know he's the one and I want to go with him as I'm about to graduate from college. Should I have waited to commit to this until we've been dating for longer? It just seems that these problems pop up if were away from each other for a long time.

Someone please tell me your thoughts? I'm not sure what to think. If anyone in the military or Army has an opinion that would also be helpful."
778,"For some background. I've had some mental health problems for a while. I joined the army at 17 and had to discharge at 19 due to severe anxiety and bipolar disorder. It was just the reserves in Canada with no obligation to serve any specific amount of time so it was an honorary discharge. I was in university at the same time but again had to drop out a few months later after being discharged from the army led to me being suicidal for a while. The next two years of my life were basically spent in therapy, living with my parents and working shit minimum wage jobs. So that's two years of my life I basically flushed down the drain. 

I'm starting school again next semester, all my friends I graduated high school with will have been graduated. And I just feel...... Outgrown. Not just professionally/career wise. But even our ideas of fun differ. My friends went clubbing and partying a lot in their late teens/early twenties. I didn't. Both due to depression and being busy with army stuff a lot of the time. So my idea of fun tends to be going out dancing at places my friends got sick of by the time they were 19 simply because I didn't get the chance to spend a lot of time there when I was their age. Some weekends I find myself going alone. Other times when people are talking about their futures I get really depressed thibking about how I'm probably not going to be finished school until I'm 26-27. By which time a lot of my friends will have stable careers, marriages, maybe even kids. And I'll be five years behind. Honestly I'm not sure how to bring this up with people. And I don't exactly know how to make new friends to do stuff with thst my friends don't wanna do anymore because I've basically forgotten how to make new friends(Most of my friends have been with me since we were 11)."
779,"Apologies for being vague in advance but I don't want to share too many identifying details.

I am exhausted.

I love my girlfriend with every fiber of my being, and I know that she loves me just as much and that I'm one of only a few dependable sources of happiness in her life. But she is severely depressed due to, among other things, a significant loss she suffered and it has gotten to the point that she is self-harming. I know it has happened before we started dating but it happened again recently and for the first time since we've been together. I know not to express anger or disappointment when it happens because it's not about me, but it still hurts me to see her hurt herself. I know she does it because when she feels everything spiraling out of control she feels like it's the only way she can feel like she's in control of anything.

She has taken all the usual advice and has been seeing a therapist for years and takes her medication regularly and as long as she continues to fight to get better I have no problem continuing to pour myself into her and being supportive. But to be honest she comes out of therapy more anxious and upset, and has told me she doesn't seem to feel any significant improvement from medication. There have been MANY long nights where I've held her in my arms and just listened while she cried and tried to explain her feelings and anxieties. I love this person and will continue to be supportive and understanding, but I'm starting to worry about myself.

I feel helpless and it's starting to wear me down. I feel like I barely get time to spend on myself because all of my resources are spent supporting her. It's gotten to where I feel guilty doing things I enjoy without her. We have talked about this and even though she knows this is irrational she almost resents that I can be happy go lucky and find enjoyment in life, then when she recognizes her resentment it makes her feel even worse. So the net result is I won't even entertain the idea of doing anything for the fear of making her more depressed.

By no means do I want to end our relationship. I get that relationships require a lot of energy, dedication, and teamwork and I love this person so much that I want to spend all my time and energy on her. I just don't know what else to do but continue to be supportive and it's wearing me down.

TLDR: My girlfriend is extremely depressed, she has been seeing a therapist and is on medication but I honestly can't say that things are getting better, and after pouring every ounce of energy I have into her it's starting to take a serious toll on my mental health."
780,"Ok so I have this co-worker that I have developed a crush on.
She(19) is funny, smart, beautiful.
It is weird for me because I'm an Asian guy (19) and this is the first white girl that I have developed a crush on this way. (not sure if this is relevant, but not many white girls go for the asain guy :/ )

Anyway, I have known this girl for a few months now and I think it's safe to say I've been fully entranced with her! We always have a laugh when we talk and have a strong friendship already. The thing is, she sometimes calls me bro (I noticed that she does this alot with other people). I don't really like this because it feels like she is friend zoning me. 

But I'm scared I messed up because this is how one of our snapchat messages went:

Me: send meme about quitting job (cause we both hate the job now) 

Her: me bro

Me:😢
      Don't call me bro 🤮🤮
      HAHA

I don't know what to do now cause she saw the message but I didn't get a reply. I really want to ask her out but I'm not sure because there is alot of factors to consider like:
-She's white so what are the odds she sees me like that
-we work at the same place
-she is kinda flirty with everyone


Other notes that may be relevant:
-She was the first to break the touch barrier when we first met
-We always lightly tease each other
-She can always make me laugh, which I find incredibly attractive
-she works at the front, whereas I work at the cafe(back) so we are not always with each other, though I sometimes make the effort to talk to her at the front ( I do this with everyone though), and she sometimes makes the effort to talk with me at the back. 

So what I'm really asking is;
Have any of you had a  similar situation? 
What should I do? Tell me your stories."
781,"I am going to keep it simple and post a text conversation of an incident that just happened. The back story is I was asked to eat bovril which I have never liked and I nearly threw up, gagged, and she stormed out and started texting me, this is the conversation.

 

\[10/23, 21:38\]  B: I am absolutely horrified at the display of maturity i just witnessed. I have a gross heavy feeling at the pit of my stomach after watching and hearing you almost regurgitate all over our bed like the night we took md. 🤮 as if i actually asked you to consume manure instead of a widely popular food substance. 

I will never ever ask you to try anything again so thank you for sucking the fun out of that too and also good luck going overseas and not trying anything new. I'm going to try my hardest to forget what i just saw because i honestly feel repulsed and sad for you at the same time

\[10/23, 21:39\]  B:I actually feel embarrassed after witnessing that

\[10/23, 21:59\] T: You are over reacting, I dont like bovril it's simple, what has it got to do with the night we took MDandwhy bring that up. You can feel  as embarrassed as you want, its petty and doesn't make me a bad, weak or immature person. It's a gag relfex. I don't feel embarrassed at all you should be embarrassed at how you are acting. Have you never seen anyone gag. If it replused you that much that's your issue and you can keep that to yourself because I dont need to hear it. I wont give it another thought. You are acting completely out of line, please consider your words.

\[10/23, 22:00\] B: No I'm not over reacting, I'm telling you how much you over reacted?

\[10/23, 22:01\] B: That horrible regurgitate sound like the night of md, that's how hectic you acted now

\[10/23, 22:01\] B: But you said you hadn't tried it? So how did you know and why would you act so immaturely about just trying a food?

\[10/23, 22:02\] T: It is in the words reflex, it's not a reaction. Just because you like it doesn't mean everyone does or should. This is rediculous.

\[10/23, 22:02\] B: You didn't gag, you made that longer sound, i feel scared after hearing that and like i don't wanna be around you

\[10/23, 22:02\] B: You even said you know you over reacted

\[10/23, 22:02\] T: I'm not immature or replusive, that's your issue.

\[10/23, 22:03\] B: Lol huh?

\[10/23, 22:03\] B: You're a ficken idiot then🤣

\[10/23, 22:03\] T: Dont talk to me like that

\[10/23, 22:03\] B: Lol so ignorant can't even talk further

\[10/23, 22:04\] T: How callous can you get

\[10/23, 22:04\] B: Think about what you just said though, didn't i say you don't have to like it i know that but just to have tried it?

\[10/23, 22:04\] B: Lol so shut the fuck up

\[10/23, 22:05\] B: You acted DISTGUSTINGLY that's so not my issue that's yours🤣

\[10/23, 22:05\] T: Really you are going to talk to me like I'm some fucking cunt

\[10/23, 22:05\] B: That's how you acting

\[10/23, 22:06\] B: Like wtf? 🤣

\[10/23, 22:06\] T: No I laughed tried bovril nearly threw up, and you are carrying on like I am some piece of shit

\[10/23, 22:07\] B: No you acted completely ridiculously and over reacted and completely sucked the fun out of any activity

\[10/23, 22:07\] B: Out of ever trying anything again like ew, i never want to witness that in my life again

\[10/23, 22:08\] B: I even started to tell you to please just try normally cuz i could already see you over reacting, and then the noise that came from you🤮

\[10/23, 22:08\] T: And yes you wish to shame and belittle me to hurt me, guess what my skin is way thicker than that.

\[10/23, 22:09\] B: No I'm just telling you why I'm still not coming there after i said all will be cool after you tried it, and why i don't want to be around you right now

\[10/23, 22:09\] T: So you need to get that I suck the fun out of everything, and I gross you out and you are embarrassed of the person you love. Be careful of your words you can't just take them back

\[10/23, 22:10\] B: Otherwise I'm sure i could have just grinned and beared but instead I'm sickened

\[10/23, 22:10\] T: So I sicken you

\[10/23, 22:10\] B: I didn't say these things lol you're crazy

\[10/23, 22:10\] B: Go tell people that then, you'll just be another crazy in my life

\[10/23, 22:11\] B: This actually shows me you're not mentally well! Because i didn't say those things and now you're going to act like i have and that's gonna be your fault! 🤣

\[10/23, 22:12\] B: I'm literally sickened and grossed out by your behavior now and i can't hide that

\[10/23, 22:13\] T: Youve thought this through havent you

\[10/23, 22:13\] B: WHAT!!??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣

\[10/23, 22:13\] T: You clearly can't hide how you feel about me

\[10/23, 22:14\] B: yes at your poor display this evening like i said

\[10/23, 22:14\] B: Look I'm not going to argue about things i haven't even fucken said or where else you're taking this📷

\[10/23, 22:15\] T: Poor display? , I did nothing wrong. Listen I'm not going to talk to you. You've insulted me enough. STOP

\[10/23, 22:15\] T: Just read your messages again

\[10/23, 22:15\] B: and you've made some crazy accusations so that's great 📷

\[10/23, 22:16\] B: Yes and you're saying other shit lol"
782,"So me(F22) and my boyfriend (M26) have been dating for about a year now, and there have been an ongoing issue. I can’t really take no for an answer. I also can’t handle rejection. 

If something wouldn’t go the way I’d like it, I literally start to tear up and cry. Unintentionally... I really can’t control it. Then my boyfriend would feel bad and go along with me. But then I would feel guilty that I essentially manipulated him into doing what I want. 

For example today, I was at his house and my mom invited us for dinner, I knew that my boyfriend wanted to just stay at home and rest, cuz we just went on a little vacation and on Saturday he’s going away with his family, plus he has to work tomorrow. Also we were just eating dinner at mine yesterday, so it wasn’t like he didn’t see my parents for a long time. So I was just packing and ready to go home when he asked if it wasn’t a problem that he won’t come. And I guess that just triggered me and I teard up and cried. I said that no, it wasnt a problem; and I really meant it, I knew I didn’t want him to come, I wanted him to just stay at home because that’s what he told me he wanted to do.  But still, seeing me cry he went with me. And I felt guilty the whole time he was over. 

I would really like to change this habit of mine I just don’t know how. 
I’m also really bad at confrontation, I tear up and cry and we can’t really have a normal conversation. 

How can I be more flexible and how can I stop being like this?

Ps. This doesn’t happen really often, only when I’m not feeling the best."
783,"So currently I'm in an exclusive relationship with my boyfriend who we'll call Abe. We've been together roughly 5 months. However, I'm being actively hit on by a guy in my class who we'll call Walter.

Abe and I are incredibly compatible and get along great; conversations that were meant to be 3 minutes turn into an hour, we play video games and watch netflix/anime. When Abe asked me out I wasn't really into him (mainly because of his looks if I'm being superficial), but I went anyways thinking that looks don't matter and that maybe after a date I'd feel sparks or something: but I didn't. I didn't feel any sparks during our first kiss either and I still don't. I don't really feel much for him when we have sex, it feels like a chore. He loves me more than I love him and I feel like i'm ripping him off and wasting his time. I feel like I'm not giving him the love he deserves because he's so sweet, loving and empathetic. I wanted to have an open relationship which he was against, probably because his dating life has always been poor (i.e. he said I was the first girl he went on a second date with and he rarely got anywhere with dating apps). I also decided to date Abe because we were both virgins and I wanted to be better prepared in the bedroom for future boyfriends. When I began dating Abe, I thought of him as a ""starter-boyfriend"" or merely a summer fling-- I didn't anticipate things to go on this long, but i never broke things off with him because I genuinely enjoy his friendship.

The issue is, I have 2 classes with Walter who I see almost everyday (Monday through Thursday) and I have a massive crush on him. In fact, I had a huge crush on him before I even met my current boyfriend. I've always felt sparks for him the moment I noticed him. He's physically more my type too. I look at him and I think he's just one of the cutest guys I've ever seen whereas with Abe, I kinda have to trick my brain into finding him cute. One of the few things Walter has over Abe is that he's hilarious. He's involved with a lot of the comedy extracurriculars at our school. That's not to say that Abe isn't funny, he is, just more in a dad-joke kind of way... not really a tears of laughter kind of way. Comedy and laughter have always been important to me and I've always wanted someone to make jokes with like skits and characters. However, I do worry that Walter and I might be too similar. I've been trying to spend more time with him outside of class to get a better feel of him. I want to spend time off campus with him but I'm afraid to bring it up because that'll look like a date and I'm worried that might lead to me on Abe. Additionally, If I went off campus with Walter, I'm worried that it'll look like I'm leading him on when realistically I can't go on a date with him without it being classified as cheating.

I've had the awkward experience of bumping into Abe when walking around campus with Walter and vice versa so they know of each other and I think they're aware of the competition. I haven't told Walter I have a boyfriend but he did see Abe and I together on campus (once Abe and I were holding hands, but Walter didn't seem to notice).

Is it worth jumping ship for a guy merely because of intense feelings and having a long term crush? Does love have to have sparks? Could I still be friends with Abe if we broke up?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Classmate who I've had a crush on before meeting my BF has recently begun hitting on me. I'm wondering if it's worth jumping ship with my current guy because I feel like me and this classmate have a special spark and we have sexual tension I've never felt before.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm aware of how selfish and narcissistic I sound. Abe deserves better.  Thanks for the feedback everyone."
784,"OK, so this is my relationship story.

We met ten and half years ago and our relationship began like in a movie. We were obsessed with each other. I´ve always looked back and thought this meant we belonged together, but now I am wondering if it was unhealthy how the world didn´t seem to matter anymore, it was only us and nothing else.

We moved in 6 months later. I was looking for apartment and he was living with his mom and we thought ""what the hell, we should just save money by renting together!"". Everything was okay, I guess, but looking back I gave alot for this relationship and (maybe) I didn´t get alot in return.

We are both stoners and sometimes used speed/MDMA on the weekends and when partying but it wasn´t that often. He was selling some over the years but somehow it always ended in debt and I/we had to pay the debt. Everything was starting to be a problem and when the years went by I thought this was more and more unfair and I started resenting him, I think. We fought, alot. Things got ugly. I said some things, because I knew what would hurt him. I know him so well and I know what his insecurities are, and I used that against him, I know it´s bad and I stopped it, but I think he didn´t get over it. He acted out, didn´t hit me but pushed me, held me down, gave me bruises and really frightened me.

That all stopped about 2 years ago. But it still comes up when we are fighting. We were sure we could get over it tough, and continued our relationship. It was sooooo good at times, we are best friends, we know each other so well and we can be so good for one another, but when things are bad, they are reaaaally bad.

Now we have been together for ten years. I have finished my BA in psychology, during wich I was receiving student loans but also working. He was working full time but still I paid more in rent and the bills. He always came up with excuses, he was depressed and had bad anxiety and I always took his excuses because I didn´t want him to feel worse then he already did. But here´s the thing, I have been struggling with mental issues myself since I was a teenager and have been medicated for years now. He never wanted to do anything about his issues, so i always took more and more responsibility and paid more off of our bills. He was supporting me mentally, by being there and that´s why I let things go so far.

About six months ago he started selling oxy, because he wanted more money. I wasn´t against the money ofcourse but I was really against, and afraid of, opiates. I lost a close relative not so long ago to opiate addiction and it was really hard, he supported me through it. When he started selling, he started pushing me to try it. I always said no, but he groomed me over weeks, even months. He said it was okay to do it couple of times, it was great, made everything better. Or at least everything that was bad didn´t matter. He had already started doing it and was doing fine and I was curious, and I wanted to feel better. I started it. And regretted it. Sometimes I think I tried it because I knew our relationship wouldn´t work if he was an addict and not me. Sometimes I think he made me start because he wanted me to stay.

Couple of months in, he lost his job. I started paying the rent alone, my salary wouldn´t cover it. I took loans. He said he would pay them with me. He said we needed to do it to make ends meet. I said it would be a bad idea to take so many loans but he convinced me it would be okay. I know I share responsibility, I´m an adult, I could have stood my ground but I didn´t. I wanted things to work, I was trying to get by and I didn´t see another way out. He made so many promises that he would do this and that, get a job and help me pay and pay everything back that I had covered for us. When we were going through withrawal he would score some oxy for himself and not tell me about it. And just watch me suffer and pretend he felt as bad as me. He tried rehab but relapsed right away since I hadn´t quit using.. I´m not so sure he really tried tough, I think he went to rehab for his mom and wasn´t planning on quitting because he came home. He could have stayed with his mom and continue his sobriety. I was going to rehab later but since he relapsed and still lived at our home, I thought it would be of no use.

Now it´s six months later, and I had to leave. I am so financially broke, emotionally broke and it just seems he doesnt care. He fucking broke me and he can´t even say he´s sorry. His best friend contacted me today, said my boyfriend owed him alot of money. I was thinking of asking my parents for a loan to pay him, but then he told me all the lies. How often my boyfriend would score some oxy from him, while I was suffering from WD. He even said he would sell MY SCOOTER, my only transportation to get to work, to pay him back. I don´t know how many times I asked friends or family for money and I ALWAYS shared it with him, anything else wouldn´t even cross my mind. I was always trying to make things better so he would feel better, but he was always attacking me/screaming at me when things got bad (if he owed money and I couldnt take more loans).

I went to the country to my parents and now I´m looking for a place to live. I´m using subs right now to taper myself off of oxy, 41 hours in, yay me!

Even tough, after all this, I´m not sure if I can survive leaving him because I gave so much. How do I start a new life when I still love him more than life itself and I owe so much money I don´t know how to get back on my feet. My depression has gotten worse and my anxiety has never been this bad. I know it sounds so stupid, but I love him so, so much. I depend on him for emotional support and I can still see a life with him even after all this.

It´s so hard to see how he is reacting to it after all these years together. It´s like everything is forgotten, he just hates me for leaving him. He says things weren´t that bad, that we would have figured it out. it´s like he can´t remember the fights, the promises, the lies. He says I´m being overly dramatic, that I share alot of the responsibility how things turned out. He only remembers the good times.

But I couldnt stay, could I? This isn´t normal, is it? Why did I let things go so far?

I don´t even know why I´m writing this. Maybe to get a clearer picture of things that happened. Maybe to get some conformation that I did things right by leaving. I don´t know why I need him to see things like I do, I don´t know why I´m seeking closure or some sort of an apology. Or even another promise that everthing is going to be okay and he´s going to do better.

Sorry for how long this story is and I applaud you for reading it to the end. If you have any opinion on this, even though it´s that I am stupid for letting things go so far, let me hear it. I need it. Thank you.

TL;DR: ten years of love, addiction and shit. Now everything is over but I´m not sure I can survive it."
785,"I was going to use a throwaway for this given how Reddit usually reacts to cheaters, but I might as well face the music. I guess this is a part of owning your worst decisions. 

When you break someone’s heart you can see it in their eyes. They turn a certain way they never do any other time. I see yours now as I write this. You were sitting on my bed, we were arguing. You asked me if I still wanted to be with you, I said I didn’t want to see you anymore because school was starting and we'd been arguing a lot and I didn't think we could handle the strain. You started crying, and so did I. I let you believe things ended amicably and that I did everything right. I didn’t tell you about how I’d been sleeping around on you for the last few months. I thought I could get away without hurting you, and more importantly without hurting myself. Then you went home and your friends told you, and I had to fess up to it all over the phone, after \*much\* prying. You cried different on the phone, it hurt worse. I was a coward and a liar. And still a cheat. 

That was when I realized how much I've overestimated myself and my character. I thought I'd changed, but I was wrong. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I cheated anyway. In the act of cheating and the subsequent act of covering it up, I didn’t care about if I was wrong, at least not enough to ever admit to it. I always felt guilty and tried to quit a few times, but I eventually gave in and kept running around. I think it was because I thought I wanted more sex with more people, because I thought it was cooler, or that a guy like me needed multiple women to keep him satisfied. But I’m not sexually unsatisfied; sexually bloated is probably the better term. Sometimes I feel like nothing makes me feel anything. I feel like all I can feel now is guilt, anger, and regret, and moments of happiness that sprout from vices - weed, sex, booze. They aren’t bad by themselves, and sometimes they’re still fun with the right people, but I feel like I’m using them to fill a hole inside of myself where a person should be, not an abuser. All I ever did was use her and use her and use her. I feel like if I’m with anyone now I’m just using them, because I don’t \*really\* feel anything. Because I never could have if I could treat so many girls the way I did. That I’m just clinging to anyone new for some form of interaction or relationship, no matter how superficial it may be. No matter how toxic or parasitic it may be, to myself or her or both. Maybe I keep myself from feeling anything romantic for others because I’m so caught up in my own guilt over past relationships. I feel trapped within myself. I feel uncomfortable meeting new people for fear that maybe they know about me, that they’ll find out what kind of person I am, or that they can see it already just from meeting me. Maybe I don’t want to face that person and that’s why I keep most everyone at bay now. 

**I’m in my third year of college now, and I’ve cheated on every woman I’ve dated since the 10th grade.** A lot of times I feel like something is mentally wrong with me, because every time after I do this I *truly* do feel guilty and want to stop, and a lot of times I do end up stopping for a while and in some cases for the remainder of the relationship (not that it makes it any better, just providing context). There have been multiple instances where I've become suicidal from the self-hatred stemming from my cheating. But eventually I continue to do it. I know cheating is wrong, I've even been the victim of it, but I continue to choose to ruin my relationships and the people I'm with. I feel out of control of my sexual urges. I’m terrified that I don’t really feel anything for anyone because it’s all me fooling myself into thinking that I do until something better comes along. 

It's hard for me to let go of my guilt because I don't feel like I deserve to be happy now, like I don't deserve a reprieve. Matter of fact, I know I got off easy. I wasn’t publicly humiliated like she was. Most of the people I was close with around the time of these relationships don’t associate with me now, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want sympathy or to be told how good it is that I’m stepping in the right direction, this is me trying to go from a shitty person to a decent person and I don’t think it deserves praise. I’m simply ready to get on with my life and let go of the things I did, but I can’t. I don’t know how. In my head at night I keep seeing one break down in front of me, or another try to keep from crying, or I think of how one just hung her head after she found out I’d run around on her. They all blamed themselves every time, and some even stayed with me after I did it. And after I did it again. Maybe because they thought I’d be different or that no one could make them as happy as me, when in reality there could be nothing further from the truth. *Whether intentional or not, I manipulated some of them into staying with me after I cheated, and continued to do so after they stayed.* That keeps me awake most nights. The idea of how much I destroyed their self esteem and made them feel like dirt eats me alive. I hate myself for using so many girls the way I have. I’m so tired of myself. I’m sick of being the bad ex. I always wanted to be the guy that was a good ex, that any girl I dated knew they could come find me down the road and know I could be counted on; that I was a good man because of the way I treated them. I don’t want to be the bad guy anymore, I never really did, but I didn’t care enough to think about how my actions would affect the person I was with. I want to be someone that it didn’t work out with, not a face they think of when they tell cautionary tales about boys to their daughters. When I think of some of the things I've done I am disgusted and repulsed by my own choices, and other times just numb, because it doesn't even feel like me. But it is, and I don't want to keep fooling myself into believing I'm a better person than I actually am. 

**TLDR; I am a serial cheater and I hate myself for it. I don't know how to let go of my guilt, or if that's something I even deserve to do, but at this point I feel it's keeping me from improving as a person. How can I forgive myself? Do I even deserve it?**

I want to be a new person now, but I don’t know how to let go of the actions of the past. I feel deeds outweigh words, but I don’t know how to prove to myself that I’m different now without getting into a relationship, and I don’t want to get in one because I’m worried I’ll cheat again. (I also feel that maybe I don’t want a relationship at this point in life, or that an open relationship is more my speed, but that could stem from my fear of hurting someone again and those choices are me trying to skirt around my own flaws instead of improving them. Or maybe I’m not cut out for relationships period.) But I feel guilty trying to make any new connections ,romantic or otherwise, because I feel like I don’t deserve them, or that they’ll find out what kind of person I used to be and not want to be around me anymore. I feel like I have no idea how to navigate these emotions or how to figure out what it is I want romantically. I guess that means I should take a break from sex and relationships, and I've been trying to but sometimes I still give in (I am not currently dating anyone now) I’m really lost. Most of all I feel very, very lost. 

I think I’m going to stop now because my brain is sort of giving out and I’m struggling to find any more to say about this. I apologize if I came across as asking for praise or sympathy or to be seen as anything better than what I am, that was not my intent at all. Thank you for reading."

A girl in my flat was with her boyfriend (of over 3 years) and we clicked quickly, and made goods friends, watching tv shoes (just as friends) late into the night. Things happened with her boyfriend, and they broke up. The next day, we slept together, and have done almost daily ever since.

However, I’m now not feeling the same as her and really don’t want to continue this, even though she does. How do I cut things off with her, whilst still being amicable through the rest of our ~8 months together as flatmates before we can go our separate ways?"

😭 I’m freaking out because I just have really LOW expectations for this guy that I invited to Vegas. I paid for flight tickets and hotel stay. He agreed to pay me back tomorrow.  I already know what I might text. It won’t be rude. Just along the lines of, “You can’t go if you don’t pay me back.”

790,"Its a really bad habit I've had since I was 14, I'm 21 now. 

I can't find a certain passion with people who outwardly show their interest in me. There has to be some sort of challenge to ignite something in me. 

All my serious relationships started funny. Either she was already in a relationship or there was a blockage preventing us from being together in the beginning. 

All the people who like me, I entertain a bit but I always end up ghosting them. Sometimes I'll just be bored because its so easy, other times I just genuinely lose interest and it makes me feel bad because they'll be really cool women. 

Sometimes I feel glamorized, like ""wow this guy is into so many cool things! I want him! I think I love him!"" and it turns me off. Its almost like I'm only attracted to the people who don't really see me at first. 

Its just annoying at this point because I find myself longing for someones love when there will be someone else right next me desperately wanting my attention. 

What can I do about this"
791,"
I’m 21M and I’ve never had sex or been in a relationship. It’s not for lack of trying. It’s not just the sex, it’s also the feeling of being wanted romantically. That’s why I don’t just want a prostitute. I’ve asked out close to 100 girls. All of them say no. 

What I usually do is I try to start a conversation once or twice or three times. I’m good at making people laugh which is a good sign to me. After that, I invite them to coffee. Every single time, they say no. I feel like such a failure. All my friends have had romantic experiences but I haven’t. At a certain point, I think girls will reject me for not being experienced enough. Sometimes I feel hopeless from the lack of any positive feedback. I feel that there is no reason to assume any girl will like me back ever. What’s the point of having hope at this point?

My therapist and a lot of my female friends say that my issue is that I can rush in too fast and that I need to spend a good amount of time becoming friends with a girl first. But I’ve also heard people say that this is how you get “friendzoned”. I’m just so lost and I feel so undesirable. I try to work on my self confidence but the constant rejections always tears it down.

And before you start ripping into me, please be nice about it"

I'm like many husband, married for several years now and having two beautiful kids.

My question is simple so I will keep this short.
I'm no longer attracted to my wife for several reasons ( including serious weight gain and constant complaining) but I refuse to cheat on her. How do I MANAGE TO STAY STRONG even when it's hard to? (knowing that I will have to stay strong forever...)

 I basically have no more sexual life, making love to her is unfortunately no longer something I appreciate.
Thanks for sharing your experiences, advices or remarks.

  We've been together since we were teenagers, married for 8 years.   

He asked for a divorce late August, stating it's not fair to me and he decided he doesn't want children. I personally am on the fence when it comes with kids. I've always talked about it due to the fact that it was always in “the plan”. He soon realized he was not in the right frame of mind to ask for such a large decision. He decided to put any separation plans on hold, but I didn't think it would get this bad.   

 We are currently staying with his family while we get our newly purchased home ready. He has totally disconnected from life in general. He plays a RPing game for at least 18 hrs (wakes up at 3 AM to be sure he can connect from server). I can overhear him, found out he has an “in game” wife. I asked him not to have a spouse/SO in game for what I feel are obvious reasons. I asked him if he is developing feelings for her, he said he doesn't know and continued to speak to her/continue the character development.   

He has a psychologist apt soon, but I don't know if I can forgive him for tossing me away or refusing to spend an ounce of time alone with me.  When does it get to the point where it's enough or do I hang tight while he attempts at getting help?"
794,"Hey Reddit community, thanks for hearing me out!

I'm a (22) yr old male and my gf is (23). We started dating last year, I was her first and she was mine. I broke up with her because I felt she disrespected my religion (I'm Catholic) with something she said. (This was back in January)

She met this guy, who became her FWB from February to July (we got back together around August). She says she has/had no feelings for him and that they are only friends now. She has made it bluntly clear that there is nothing there (I believe her). 


However, everytime we are having sex or together at night he keeps on texting her. This is bothering me but I don't want to come across as weak or insecure (I did tell her that I prefer if she has distance with him). 

The texting is annoying but there is more.... He keeps sending her pics through Snapchat and she sends him selfies as well (sometimes at his request) (I found out when she showed me her phone to verify this dude is nothing more than a friend the time I brought it up).

I asked her to let him know that screenshots aren't okay as I'm uncomfortable with another guy having pics of her,  but they both still do it. 


I believe she is plainly naïve (she is very introverted) and I have a gut feeling this dude is just waiting in the shadows to screw her again.

I'm tired of this situation so I said basically that I want to meet him but he told her he ""needs time"" (if there were no feelings or anything why would he need time?).


 TL;DR

Gf with has an ex FWB who texts her (sometimes late at night) and asks her for selfies through Snapchat, he sends some too. (She seems to be telling the truth).

He avoids meeting me and she appears to not want to cease her friendship with him.

How do I make her see that sending pics all the time isn't appropriate as we are exclusive? Or should I consider leaving her."
795,"Throwaway because I don't want this attached to my main and coming back to me. I don't know who to talk to and a lot of this is word vomit, so please just bare with me here.



Been with my boyfriend (23m) for roughly 9 months, January will be one year and I love this guy. He's been great for the most part and working towards becoming a cop for our local city. Right now he's just about to enter the background investigation for this agency. This is his dream so I've been nothing but supportive, I've been there for him, I've been a good girlfriend to say the least. He never has to question how much I love him, he knows I'd do anything for him. 

For the past two months (roughly) his drinking has been getting a little out hand. He is able to drink enough for two people most nights we see each other. The thing is he gets black out drunk everytime lately and will sometimes say some pretty insensitive things, I'll end up crying, he doesn't remember any of it the next morning. When I bring up  what he said he just never remembers it, never apologizes, never accepts responsibility, and will typically just say: ""I was drunk"", ""I would never say those things"", or ""you can't be so sensitive "" and that'll be the end of the conversation. When he is drunk, if I look at him wrong he gets angry with me, if I say something wrong he gets upset, if I dont want to have sex he gets upset. You get the point. 

I can't take it anymore, I can't be his punching bag (he hasn't hit me or anything, just I dont want to be talked to like this anymore and treated like this). We've been having some problems lately, we've been fighting alot more. So, last week my roommate left for the weekend so my boyfriend and I were talking. We ended up talking about the issues going on. I tell him that he ends to cut down on his drinking and treat me better. His response was ""just go into the other room and leave me on the couch, I'll be fine."" I tell him I'd rather be single that put up with that. I tell him how his drinking has been negatively affecting the relationship. He thinks I'm too sensitive and I need to change that. I stick to my guns and say ""if you don't cut down on your drinking and treat me better, I need to walk away."" He shut down on me and got drunk and we didnt talk much for the rest of the night. The only thing he really said was ""I hope you don't leave but I'm not going to beg you to stay."" That killed me cause I havent felt like I'm worth fighting for and that just kinda put the nail in the coffin for that feeling. He leaves the next morning we dont talk much for the past few days.

Last night we had been fighting over text and he was saying he just wont drink with me anymore and that will solve itself. I don't buy it, I just feel like its not solving the problem cause hes still gonna drink with other people and I just see him lying to me about it. We fight/talk for another hour or two about his drinking. We finally stop and he out of nowhere is like ""you really screwed me OP, you fucked my chances of getting my dreams."" And I'm like what the fuck are you talking about. He goes on to tell me that when the investigators start the background check if they see all these messages he's not gonna pass and it's my fault solely (he made that very clear) and when he doesnt get in hes gonna leave me because I couldn't keep my mouth shut and tell him in person and ruined his chances of becoming a cop. I'm fucking speechless to say the least. I tell him I will not take responsibility for his drinking and having to bring up the issues before things are too late. He still like is like ""you fucked my chances OP"". I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like if I'm going to be blamed for his drinking then I need to walk away but I don't want to because I fucking pictured a life with this dude. I love him so much but i just cant be held responsible for his actions. 

I guess I just need advice/get this out because I dont know who to talk to this about. It feels completely wrong. 

Tdlr: bf has drinking problem, I tell him I'm leaving if it doesnt get better, he blames me for ruining his chances of a cop because of the text messages"
796,"I like my girlfriend. I don't have many complaints about her - sometimes she's a little demotivated to do with doing activities, sometimes I wish she was more confident in herself - but those are both things I try to work on with her.

Early on in the relationship, I didn't reciprocate 'i love you' but now I do, but to be honest I don't mean it. Now I even say it out of the blue but only because it makes her happy.

I just don't know what love is. I don't love my parents, or any family for that matter. They aren't bad people or anything, but if my parents got replaced by other people with the same amount of money I don't think I'd mind. 

As much as I like my girlfriend, if it all ended I'd be annoyed at most, because we had a good thing going. She's not irreplaceable though. 

At the moment I'm trying to decide if I should try to spend my life with her. She's my first girlfriend, so I don't have anything to compare my lack of love to. I don't know if it's a me or a her problem."
797,"Hey all. I'm a 34f that has an amazing group of friends. I'm really good friends with two women, mom (M) and daughter (D). D is my age. D has another friend that I know pretty well but not as well as D, I'll call her F. F is also our age or so. We all used to work together and started doing girls night once a week and it's super fun. There was a small break and we are now back to having girls night. The last girls night, F invited a friend, same age as all of us (except M of course) and I'll call her B. Thing is, I've known B for a very long time, way before I met M, D, and F. B and I had a falling out about 3 or 4 years ago now. B has a daughter the same age as my daughter and they are best friends. Basically, my whole family is friends with Bs whole family except for me and B. I find B to be extremely negative, likes to start drama, and just isn't really friend material. I 'play nice' with B especially for my daughter's sake because that's not fair to my daughter and Bs daughter but I don't like to spend any more time around B then I have to. So when B showed up to girls night, my night tanked but I left at my normal time and didn't say or do anything to make a scene. I thought it was a one off thing but Bs now in a group chat and seems to be invited from now on. I feel very petty and childish to not want to hang out with my other friends just because I don't like B or want to hang around her. I want to tell my friends why I don't want to go to girls night but I don't want to start drama or make them feel like they would have to 'choose' between me and B. I know M would be very understanding and I'm pretty sure D would understand too but I'm not sure how F would react. I just feel like I'm making a big deal out of this and don't want to ruin girls night but I really think I would not have a good time if B is at them from now on. I guess I'm looking for advice on how I should approach the group about this or maybe even if I'm being too petty and should just suck it up and deal with B for the chance to hang out with my really good friends.

TLDR: friend invited a girl I had a falling out with to girls night and now I don't want to go."
798,So me(m18) and my ex (f17) are wanting to get back togeather after being off and on for a while. The only thing stopping us is her mother she dosent not want us dating and when we were dating she put a lot of stress on our relationship. What should I do in this situation
799,"My ex and I had been having a slightly rocky relationship for a few weeks prior to our breakup. He wasn't addressing issues I had been having in our relationship (I.E. drug use, lack of quality time). Previously we had had a great relationship, so much so to the point that my running joke to our mutual friends was ""at least I don't have to worry about him cheating"" (He was always having close misses playing ultimate frisbee or snowboarding or skating and I worried about him getting injured). 

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year I found out that my boyfriend of a little over 10 months had ""cheated"" on me.  This absolutely destroyed me because I have a deep seeded fear of abandonment as well as mild bout of eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia. I had found out through my ex's best friend and his girlfriend at the time. He confirmed with me that he had seen it happen. We had a pretty nasty breakup that was strictly over text because he refused to meet me in person because I had apparently already ""made up my mind"".Of course he denied cheating but thats what cheaters do, right?

&amp;#x200B;

I ran in to one of our mutual friends the other day and we started talking about relationships in general. She ended up telling me that he said to her in full confidence that he had not cheated on me and had been very upset that I would have suggested it. She also told me that his best friend is jealous of him in many ways, and she believes that he is more than capable of spinning a story to get his way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have no idea what to do. I was the one who broke off our relationship. I deleted everything that I had of him, gave back his stuff that he had left with me and gone through months of therapy. We haven't talked for well over a month and haven't been dating for at least two or three. I am absolutely gutted because I not only lost the person that I felt most safe around, I lost my best friend. Now that I know this and now that I have real doubt as to if he cheated, I am at a loss as to what to do. I haven't seen him in so long, I have no idea how he is doing, if he is seeing anyone new, anything.  I don't know if I should just bite the bullet and reach out to him somehow or if I should just leave it at that. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

801,"Hello reddit, here is my story. 

I (26yo M) started dating my gf (24yo F) almost exactly 2 years ago. I thought we had a great relationship, but she dumped me on Saturday morning. Before, all of our friends always thought we were really great. We each were really liked by the other's family. She and her little sister are super close and I even became a big brother sort of figure for her sister. We were actually roommates in a house originally and took the chance and started dating. It was great, we explored, cooked together, worked out, played games, tennis, vacations, literally all the fun things a couple could do and we always expressed our love to each other. She got a new job about 1 year into our relationship and moved 1 hour away in January. We were then able to pretty much see each other on the weekends and did a lot of facetime. Then, in May, I graduated school and moved to her city for a couple months, but my job was terrible and couldnt find another, so I took a new job in a city about 40 min apart. With this we were able to see each other on weekends, and sometimes once during the week. Not really long distance, but not what we once were either, why I call it pseudo-distance. 

Anyways, the last 3 months or so we certainly had more arguments than normal, but I thought we always came to a good resolution and tried to learn from it. She always told me she was a huge believer in the power of love and is the type to stay committed to a relationship, so if problems came, she doesn't just run from them, she figures it out. Well, she came on Saturday morning and simply said we had to break up and she just wasn't in love with me anymore. She said a ton of things that throw me off though. One week prior, she wrote me a love letter and a poem, both showing how much she loved me and how committed she was to making us great. She even wrote, ""I freaking love you and I am in this, just as much as you are"". When breaking up with me, she said multiple times Im amazing, the best boyfriend, she misses me already, she wishes she felt the same way, but she just felt we weren't meant for each other and she took her friends advice of ""you know when you know"". One day after our breakup, she posted 9 happy pictures of us on her IG with the caption ""It was a privilege loving you and being loved by you was the greatest gift. You're amazing and I just wanted everyone to know it"". 

Im just so confused by all this and how she changed her mind so quickly and didn't even try to talk to me about it. I've gone full no contact since our last text conversation. I wonder if she'll come back or if I should even hope she comes back. I see the emotional immaturity and it's definitely a negative, but I also believe in learning and growing from these things so I guess Im hoping she reaches out after a period of self-reflection. 

TLDR: 2 year relationship seemed great, gf dumped me out of the blue and posted/said a lot of things that sound like regret to me. Gone No contact but still hopeful."
802,"Hi everyone

I need some very serious advice. I have been in a relationship with my current partner for the past 5 and a half years, of which the first three years I was happy. The last two years I made some pretty serious mistakes like visiting prostitutes and having sex with workmates.

I was honest to my partner about these mistakes, and she forgave me for each. However, she brings up on occassion about how she doesn't trust me, and it's been getting to the point where I can't even go to a supermarket without her thinking I'm doing something wrong. I haven't done anything in the past 7 months and I've also made sure to have STD checkups and I'm clean.

I've thought about the reasons for why I did the things I did, and I told her recently that I would like to explore having a non-monogamous relationship (sex with others only). She however wants a purely monogamous relationship, and can't understand why I feel the way I do.

We both still love each other, and she's special to me however I want to be able to also explore my sexuality. She is not open to that idea, so I don't know what to do."
803,"So a little over a month ago my first ever girlfriend broke up with me (we’re both 16 and were together for 16 months), and I haven’t felt the same way since. I’ve been heartbroken &amp; depressed and I honestly don’t know what to do. She still wants to be my friend, but even after a month of limited contact with her I’ve made barely any progress. I’ve been getting out more &amp; focusing on school, but I just don’t know what to do. All I want right now is help."
804,"My SO is absolutely perfect on paper - he's attractive, ambitious, financially stable, dependable, patient, kindhearted and prioritizes me. In the beginning of our relationship, I was initially attracted to his intelligence and over time, I loved that he treats me so well. He's always helped me accomplish my goals and supported me through the ups and downs of life. He's been a great partner and I'm grateful for all he's done. 

As we start to plan our wedding, I'm starting to have doubts that while our values and long term life goals are aligned, we might be missing that ""spark"" or chemistry. Specifically, I feel like playfulness, sillyness, banter, laughter, flirtyness and spontaneity are missing from our relationship. He can be described as a more serious, anxious and introverted person whereas I'm lively, bubbly, extroverted and charismatic. 

I worry that if chemistry is missing now, our relationship will become even more stale after we get married and I'll be bored 5, 10 years from now. I've brought this issue up to him multiple times but he got defensive when he realized I was nitpicking at his personality traits. I realize it's hard to ask someone to just make you laugh or it's hard to describe HOW he can be more playful. 

I don't know what to do because although we're in an otherwise stable relationship, I do feel there's something missing. The hardest part is that we're doing long distance so it's tough to work on these issues together. Sometimes I feel like asking to take a break from our relationship, but I also don't know how that would help us resolve any of our issues.

How important is that ""spark"" in a relationship and does it fade over time? Is chemistry absolutely essential for long lasting, happy marriages? Am I missing out on something in life by not having intense chemistry in our relationship?"
805,"Long time lurker, first time poster and yada, yada, yada...

So, back in June I started talking to someone online who is 30ish. We didn’t actually meet up till August, which was fine in my books. When we did, it was an instant connection on my part. I’ve been single for a year and a half. I haven’t been looking in that time though, so this connection made me pretty excited!

We saw each other once or twice a week for a couple months. All is going well. I’m a very artsy person, but he was more in the science world, which fascinated me. Had lots of deep conversations and generally enjoyed our time.

I always held back a bit because my intuition was saying something was off. I wasn’t sure what it was, but I’ve learned to trust that feeling over the years.  Then, one night, he asks me to come over late at night as he was getting back from a trip. I obliged thinking he wanted to see me after being gone. That’s when he told me.

He still wasn’t over his ex that he broke up with over 8 months ago. She was in another state and he’s planning to go see her. He had not asked her if she wanted to come up there. He asked me how I felt about that, and I said I’d need to think about it. I stayed the night that night. 

A few days later, we met up to talk about it. We both agreed we shouldn’t keep seeing each other if he was going to get back in contact with his ex. Again, I still hung out with him that night. It might be a dumb thing, but besides this ex situation, we had a very close connection. We had a great night besides the talk. He said he’d track me down once he figured everything out, so there was a part of me that was hopeful. 

Since I’m an artist - abstract in nature - a few days later a drawing came out of my brain and I posted it on Instagram. It’s basically two people cuddling. He saw it on Instagram and sent me a message even though we had agreed on no contact. I wasn’t upset that he did.

A week later, he sent me a message saying “this might be a bad idea, but do you want to go to a concert tonight?” Me, being a sucker for bad ideas, said yes. I didn’t have many expectations for the night going in. I knew it was probably a one-off thing.

We had a great night. Very much enjoyed each other. Before we fell asleep, we got into a convo about the situation. Basically, we’re going to go back to no-contact. Okay, that’s fine. I asked if he had spoken to ex about going up to see her. He said he wrote her a letter, but hasn’t heard back. He also said that he was going to go up to see her even if he doesn’t. I asked him if he talked to his friends about that idea. He said he had. I asked him what they said. He let me know they thought it was a dumb idea and asked if I thought so too. I said “yeah, doesn’t sound great.”

So, alarm bells are up because wtf would you randomly go try to talk to an ex that you broke up with? On the other hand, I’m insanely attracted to this person, which doesn’t happen often with me. 

The next morning, we talked a bit more about us and the ex. I don’t remember what started it, but he broke down. I think he was crying on my shoulder for about an hour, which I tried my best to console him. 

From my point of view, it seems like he’s depressed. It seems more like he harbors a lot of guilt over this breakup, and getting back together will cleanse him of some wrongdoings. It’s like a penance. I doubt that it will work out between them, but who knows.

So here I am three weeks later. I’m over it, but not completely. Problem is, there’s a big event coming up that I know he will be there for. I have spent a good amount of money on the ticket and costume, so there’s no way I’m not going.

I know I’ll probably see him. I know I’m probably going to want to talk to him. Even if I don’t go up to him, there’s a good chance he’ll come up to me. My friends will be there, but I don’t even trust them enough to protect me from myself. It’s also not their job. 

I’m so conflicted. I don’t know how to act in all this. I’m usually very levelheaded, but this whole thing makes me feel like an insane person. 

What do I do? This whole thing has a weird hold over me. Should I say “fuck this noise” and move on with my life? Should I skip the event? Should I go and make sure I don’t even make eye contact? 

Ugh... this is why I was single for long. Relationships are so nuts! Please advise and help me not make a mistake!"
806,"Please, I’ve never had a GF before"
807,"Prior info: I am 42F, lesbian with a child (13) from a previous relationship. My partner L is 38F with no kids. L and I have been together 7 months. We are in the UK.

L has made it known to me from near the beginning that she would like to have kids. I simultaneously let her know that this is a deal breaker for me. I don’t enjoy parenting. She thinks this may be largely because I had a very unsupportive partner in the past and had to do everything myself. I think that might have a bearing, but generally I just don’t like kids from about 2-10 years old.

We get along very well and all is great, but I kept saying that we need to discuss this properly and not stick our heads in the sand. Last night we had a proper discussion. 

She is adamant that she won’t have a child alone. Also, she needs NHS funding to sort her eggs because she is a carrier of a genetic disease. This could be done privately but would be very expensive for us. The NHS will only find this for women under 40. (My eggs are unusable.)

We came to the point where we said perhaps we should split up over this as there is no middle ground. Neither of us want to split up. Adoption is not an option for her.

She would make an amazing mum. 

I feel like whatever way we go someone is going to resent the other. Or we break up. 
I’m not entirely sure what I’m asking here, but any advice would be welcome as we don’t know how to get through this.

Time is obviously of the essence, I don’t want to waste her time with me when she could be with someone who wants a child, but she says she wants me and not someone else. I want to give her what she wants but don’t want to destroy my life in the process.

Also, we realise this is very early in the relationship and would give it at least another 6 months before trying. 

Any advice?"
808,"I broke up with my girlfriend three weeks ago. We are both 23, I'm male and she is female.This was an 11 month relationship. She has gotten a new boyfriend and I'm happy for her, but now I can't help thinking about our relationship. I broke up with her because I wanted a different type of woman to be in a long term relationship with. She did a few things that frustrated me.
1 - She didn't handle stress well. I mean she blew up or started shutting down just attempting to find some misplaced item. 
2 - She got frustrated when I didn't show her all the affection she wanted. She knew I wasn't an  affectionate guy. 
3 - She was incredibly messy, for a number of reasons, and always seemed ok with living in the mess. 

Because of this I felt my emotions for her wane over the months leading up to me breaking things off. I hesitated a bit because when we had our moments life was good but my emotions for her could never match her emotions for me. After all of our problems/fights she deeply loved me, but I knew I could never give her the love she deserved. Now even though I'm happy being single I cant help but reflect. ""Were the issues really that bad? Could I not have just tried things her way? Even though lots of affection makes me uncomfortable, could I have grown to enjoy it?"" She and I are still friends and she tells me the knew guy is closer to her personality. 

Has anyone else felt like this and if so how did you move on from it?"
809,"Warning, this post contains sensitive, personal information. 

I had a rough childhood in the sense that things were unstable, my father abandoned us (I was 6) and my mother was an absent heroin addict. My father was very abusive and beat my brother and me for the dumbest things (not finishing dinner or not cleaning our room) but he left us for what I’m now sure was a prostitute. I grew up in the suburbs of a somewhat large city with just one older brother (I had a half sister I met a few times, also a drug addict like my mom, died from overdose). For most of my childhood my brother took care of me and made sure I was safe while our mom was out getting high. However, when I was 8 years old and he was 15 it was like he became a completely different person. My brother started to get into trouble at school; in one case he brutally beat a boy two years his senior almost to death. He got into a lot of trouble with the cops, but my mother was not there to guide him down the right path. He started down an ugly path of destruction (arson, robbery, and joined a gang). 


NSFW WARNING

I remember the first night he violated me and probably always will despite years of therapy. We shared a bedroom in a shitty apartment (mom was on welfare, we were poor) and he came in on a school night probably around 11-12 at night. I woke up when he was trying to sneak in, but he wasn’t very inconspicuous and I am a light sleeper. He stood probably a foot away from my bed and I could smell alcohol on him. It was weird because he spoke to me very softly and what seemed gentle and not hurtful when he said we were going to play a game and I had to wear his bandanna as a blindfold. I thought we were going to play hide and seek (I was 8, didn’t know any better) but he covered my mouth with his hand, lifted up my nightgown, tore off my underwear, and molested me for what felt like an eternity. I had no idea what was happening at first and didn’t even understand when it was all happening but I cried and whimpered and my body was so tense. He molested me with his hands and a metallic, cold object. I think I eventually passed out from the pain and not being able to breathe (he covered my mouth the whole time). When I got up for school the next morning he was already gone, my mother was gone too, and I was home alone supposed to get myself ready for school (not unusual for me). There was blood in my sheets and I was very confused. I went to school as normal but sometime in the afternoon there was blood in my pants. I went to the school nurse who assumed I was having my period, gave me pads, and sent me on my way. A couple months went by before he attacked me again, this time I didn’t smell alcohol, he just seemed so angry and was being very aggressive. He did not blindfold me or cover my mouth this time, instead he penetrated my anus as I cried loudly and begged him to stop but mom wasn’t home and nobody was going to save me. I tried to fight back by scratching at his face and trying so hard to get out from under him but he was already 6 feet tall at 15 years old and I wasn’t strong enough. The next and last time he attacked me he was 16 and I was 9. I think I got somewhat of amnesia during the time that passed because I didn’t remember what happened until he raped me for the last time and it all came back. My mother came home with some random druggie guys and they were probably all getting high in the living room when I was getting ready to go to bed. My brother was not home and who the hell knows what he was doing, I don’t even want to know. When he got home my mom was already passed out I guess, but her boyfriends were still there. This time was the worst and the scariest. He got ready for bed (he usually just came in and crashed or spent the whole night out) so it was weird to me he was taking a bath and brushing his teeth or whatever. He came into our room and I was just starting to fall asleep. He climbed into my bed and I laid as still as possible pretending to be asleep. He whispered in the dark to me in the most terrifying and dead voice, “I’m sorry”. He grabbed my throat, mounted me, and penetrated my vagina. It was so sudden and so vicious and awfully painful. I screamed this time, for the first time I was able to find my voice, and one of my moms boyfriends came bursting in yelling and beat the shit out of my brother. My brother was arrested and I tried to forget everything for the next 12 years. He was put in juvey, had to attend therapy, and diagnosed with antisocial disorder. I was amazed how much my mother reacted and how she changed completely, she attended rehab (first time left, but second time stayed and got so much better). We moved into a new apartment and stayed there until I was 17. I graduated high school and moved to a new city to go to community college and work full time. My mom passed away from a long battle with HIV/AIDS when I just turned 18. My brother ended up in prison for a few years doing time for robbery. I struggled with my moms loss especially since we were closer now and she became the mom I really needed. My brother got out of prison a week ago and since has tried to make contact with me. I live on my own and was terrified when I got a missed call from him asking if he could borrow money. His “apology” sounded very sincere on the phone but he was always a charming kind of person and I have no intention to see him or help him. I contacted the police but there’s nothing they can do for now and changed my number. I don’t think I’m ready to forgive my brother and he’s probably just trying to use me. I’ve been staying with my friend to be safe. I don’t know what to do. So much shit has happened in my life it’s really affecting me and I feel like I’m going to have a full blown break down. 

TLDR: brother sexually assaulted me in childhood, he went to juvey and prison, got out, and is now trying to make contact with me."
810,"Can you truly leave someone if you're in love with them? Say this person tells you they love you &amp; are in love with you but choose to leave because of past toxic/abusive behavior that you instilled into the relationship (Cheating, emotional abuse).

811,"Me (21m) my now ex girlfriend of 2 years  (21f) just broke up because she's been dealing alot of pressure from work and home life and its been really effecting her mental health so much that she thinks that's is having an affect on our relationship, so until she's sorted out her mental state we've decided to break up, I'm not sure what to do now because I really wanna be there for her as I love her that much that I just wanna be there for her but I can't as it'll be harder for both of us to move on so she can help her mental health, so I dunno what to do or think?

812,"So, this is going to be a long one. Also, my native language is spanish so excuse any mistake. I wrote a [post before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cc138p/aita_for_blocking_my_29f_dads_68m_number_after_he/) on AITA about my shitty dad, well, the sister I'm talking about is the one that on my previous post I stated slept with my father (she's my half-sister, we grew up together and to me she's my sister).

**Background**: I (29F) grew up with my two sisters (from another mister who wasn't on the picture ever) and my mom (she's on her early 60s). My sisters are 8 and 10 years older than me, the one I'll talk about here is the mid child, and I'll call her Cherry (37), the other one I'll call Sabrina (39). Cherry got pregnant at 16, her BF left her and then was never on the picture. She also got kicked out of the house for that (by my awesome mother). She then came back when my nephew was older and everything was forgiven. Then she got pregnant again, from a junkie friend whom she was dating, he was a catch who stole from his grandma to buy drugs. And some years later she AGAIN got pregnant, this time, from a guy she met on the bus and never dated... also, the guy had a pregnant GF. My sister sure can pick'em.

In the middle of all this, she managed to finish high school and got a secretary diploma, but she never wanted to work from 9 to 5, so she never used it. Instead, she worked at bars, and at shady places where she had to wait tables on a thong, and as a sex worker on a club. In the later years, she hasn't had a steady job, she says that's imposible because she have two little kids (but they go to school almost ALL DAY) so she buys stuff and re-sell them for profit, she also gets a lot of help from the State and from men she dates, she currently lives in an apartment she's not paying for, and has more money saved up that me, but she always complaints about money. Among those men who have paid her is my father, he is obsessed with her and used to give her money for sex. She has claimed that when she was young (15-16) my mother facilitated her to my father and made her walk naked in front of him before they had sex. I learned this when I was older. Cherry has never had a place of her own and carries a huge grudge against our mother, but she lived with her until a couple of years ago. My mother is a cocaine and alcohol addict, and was living alone until a year ago, when Cherry kicked my oldest nephew out of the house because he wouldn't work a summer job (he did not want to, he goes to college and wanted to rest) and he ended up living with my mother. Cherry is the kind of person that will say you are terrible, abusive and the worst, but will live thanks to your help anyway. I live in another city and only see my family like once or twice a year, but every time there's a problem they call me.

**NOW**

Yesterday I received a disturbing message from my cousin, who lives with my grandma. She said that my sister got mad at my nephew (12, with a diagnosis of ADHD and impulse control disorder) because he talked back at her, and she punched him  repeatedly on the face and head. Then she hit my niece too. She told him not to cry or she would break his computer and phone. The reason? he grumbled while she was making him go pick up something she had threw.

I knew that Cherry would say he's a lot to handle and make excuses about it, so instead of talking to her I talked with Sabrina and told her what happened. She went on out whatsapp group and said to Cherry ""Why did you hit your son, you can't do that, the state is going to take him away!"" and Cherry got mad, she said that we were talking behind her back, and we weren't no one to judge her, we don't know anything about her life and she too can say a lot about Sabrina but she always support her and that she remembers when his son was little and I pulled his hair (pins? I don't know this word). I was shocked, she wasn't acknowledging anything, she only focused on who we were and on stupid stuff I did when I was little... so I told her, it doesn't matter what anyone did, only matters what you do, you are his mother and is your job to protect him not to hurt him. She said again we can't judge her and that we didn't even ask her what happened. I told her it did not matter, because she cannot punch his little kid, no matter what he did. And she left the group.

Her kids are super hard to handle, I'll give her that, but she's the one to blame. She has always been  immature, she argues with them like she's a kid too, she mocks them and laughs at them and when she loses it, she beats them or threatens to break their stuff. This was one of the reasons I was happy my oldest nephew does not live with her anymore.  It's like she hates the fact that they exist, because she clearly cannot do whatever she likes with her life now.

After that, I talked to her to know her side of the story, and she replied to me the same bullshit. That her kids were a lot to handle, that she takes them to the psychiatrist and psychologist, and they're both under medication for ADHD, and they fight for everything and that Sabrina is no one to talk abour her, and my cousin hits them too, and my grandma always take the kid side, SHE DIDN'T EVEN ADMIT SHE DID ANYTHING WRONG, she put excuse after excuse for like half an hour, making every point about how her life is hard, she's a victim and her kids are awful. I told her I did not care about any excuses and that I was beaten up as a kid and I did not wanted my nephew and niece to go through that, I told her ""you don't know what's like that the only person in your life who's supposed to love you no matter what will beat you all the time and for nothing!"" and she replied ""you don't know what I know about, my mother facilitated me to your father and that's worst I think!"" Then I lost it, I told her something like ""yeah your life sucks, you had a shitty childhood and a shitty mother, and later in life made shitty choices, but you shouldn't want your kids to pay for them, you should love them, not hit them, and if I hear that you did it again I won't bother with trying to talk to you because you don't listen!"" and she stated ""oh you talk that way to me but when it comes to Sabrina you chicken out""... and it was like... oh my god she really doesn't get it... i told her bye and that was it. She deleted my number and eliminated me from social media.

I don't know what to do... I'm scared she's going to take it on the kids, I know I could report her, but I'm afraid it'll only escalate the situation, they won't take her kids, they'll only scare her and it will feed her notion that everyone of us is against her. Also, I was not a witness to the beating, so I told my cousin she should talk to the kid's psychologist so they help.

I don't know what advice can you give me, I wanted to vent, this is so frustrating.

TLDR: My sister is abusive towards her son and daughter. I had it and tell her to stop posing as the victim and care for her children, she only put excuses then blocked me. I don't know what to think.

EDIT: RELEVANT. Because she gets help from the State, she goes to mandatory counseling and is currently in a Parental Skills program. But it's clearly not working. She also goes to the shrink with them for the ADHD diagnosis."

815,"Husband (43M) cheated on me (42F) with a several-month affair.  Outed himself a few months ago by butt-dialing me.  I’ve never been so hurt in my life and I grew up with the world’s shittiest parents so that’s saying something.  Gut reaction of course was to throw his clothes in the street, change the locks and file for divorce immediately.  But I agreed to give it a try for awhile.  We are in couples therapy and are also each in individual therapy.  He says he loves me and wants to save our marriage.

My question is this:  how does that make any goddamned sense?  He and all three therapists are trying to convince me that he can love me and “make a mistake.”  I think that is bullshit and you don’t treat anyone you love so terribly. 

Our marriage hinges on this concept so I need to choose to accept it, or not.  I just wish I could make sense of it.  I understand life is not always black or white but this seems like it is one thing that fucking should be.  

So if you cheated on your spouse - did you love him or her?  If so - why did you cheat then?"
816,"About 2 years ago my mom started seeing this man, Adam. They met through a dating app and talked for 6 months before meeting up because he refused to meet up. After they finally did they hung out and a couple months later he moved in. They fought constantly about petty things, mostly him calling her names. One day they went shopping and they came back and she was in tears because they went to a thrift store (my mom loves thrift stores) and he said she was ""a joke"" for shopping at a thrift store. He packed his things up and left. They still talked even though I told her he was no good. A couple months later he moved back in. Everytime they went shopping he would make my mom pay for everything even though he was a single man with a good job and my mom has 4 kids to take care of. She spoke up about it one time and he said, ""I thought all the money was our money"" even though he never paid for anything. He moved out again. They are still talking and sometimes see each other. Sometimes when they fight she asks my advice and I give it, she tells him what I say and he talks crap about me, saying stuff like ""she's only (my age) she doesn't know anything about life yet"", or ""if it wasn't for her boyfriend she wouldn't get to go anywhere, she doesn't have any friends"". He just got back from the Virgin Islands (he is working there) and asks to see my mom yesterday. She says yes and this morning started getting ready to see him, he doesn't text her all day, until she says,"" are we still seeing each other"", he says nothing and after 3 hours past the time they were supposed to see each other says, ""I'll see you but only...."". She says she's done with him but she's said that so many times, I know she'll end up seeing him again and I don't want her to. How do I convince her not to see this man?

817,"Hey all, I’m sure some of you have been in this situation before, and I wanted some input from you all to see what you would say. 9 months ago in February I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years due to us being very different people and having different aspirations. The break up was mutual, and though it went well, it was hard. She was not mad at me and we had no hard feelings toward each other, since we had both seen the same things, talked about it, and decided this was the best course of action for us. However, she has since seemingly not taken it well. She sent a few very aggressive sub-tweets about me unprovoked about a month or 2 after we broke up. I saw her at a 4th of July party thrown by mutual friends and she pretended like I didn’t exist, often going out of her way to make wide circles around me, and completely ignoring anything I said in conversation. I even caught her glaring at me a few times as well. I have not said anything to her or had any interaction with her since that party, and I only had  1 interaction with any of her family, playing soccer with her brother in August which went well and he didn’t have any hard feelings. 

I did love her and do care about her, and as such haven’t said anything bad about her to friends, mutual or otherwise. We don’t talk or interact at all, but I know she had talked poorly of me to mutual friends, and I have been phased out of the friend group with the exception of one person. However my real issue is I’m friends with quite a few of her family members on FB, and I’m not sure what to do. I thought my best course of action was to unfollow her (since that’s what she did to me) and leave her alone and let her live her life. But I have since started dating another woman, and I keep having my ex’s family members posts on my feed, and it doesn’t feel right, and I’m not sure what to do. Any advice is appreciated, and if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Thank you all."
818,"I have been married for almost 3 years now (Hetero couple, in our twenties).We were crazy in love, daydreamed about having children together, and buying a home together. However, since May, things have gone to shit.
He had specifically told me he doesnt want children anymore. I thought it would be fine, and thought we worked it out cuz he was gonna divorce me if I didn't agree to be childless. I seriously thought we worked it out but my resentment is growing since he almost dumped me over something we previously agree on.
Now, another serious issue we have is that he likes to drink with his friends (which I had NO problem with until recently). First problem with that is he got flirty and touchy with a female coworker in FRONT of me. We discussed it the next day and he agreed to take it easier.  However, he didn't seem very sorry and didn't take responsibility for his actions and mostly blamed the alcohol. However, I thought we moved past it.
Second problem. While we were out partying with his friends, (after the previous incident) he blamed ME for not being able to take another shot with them because I ""MADE HIM."" Everyone got defensive of my husband and basically were telling him that I wasn't his boss. This really pissed me off cuz he threw me under the bus like that. Entirely shifted the blame from himself to me. I will not be hanging around with his friends anymore.
Now, that same coworker he was getting flirty and handsy with added him on facebook. I am SUPER uncomfortable with this, and BEFORE they were fb friends I specifically told him I felt uncomfortable with him getting drunk around her or any other women for that matter, since he basically blamed the alcohol and I didn't know what he'd do while I was gone. 
My husband keeps getting mad at me for voicing my concerns and always tells me I'm ""over reacting."" He keeps crossing boundaries and I keep giving him second chances. Like he refuses to stop partying at all. Doesnt matter if the girl from work is there or not. But I've become bitter with him and feel like I have to try to control him (say things like I dont want you at that party, block her on fb, etc). But that has only been going on for a week. He keeps calling me jealous and insecure, but I dont know what to do or think. I'm thinking I should just divorce him at this point cuz hes just gonna get worse if he doesnt accept boundaries now, right?
I also saw that she is in a group chat with him on facebook and has messaged him one on one. I just dont know what to do."
819,"I’m 18m and my g18f have recently broken up which has just completely destroyed me and it’s like she doesn’t care. It’s been like 5 weeks now and she won’t give me a straight answer on why we broke up, I’m hearing different stories from everyone. I’m just completely heartbroken, I’m crying a lot and I just want her back. I’ve been told that she thought the relationship got stale but recently I went to hers for the handover and she slept with me (she initiated it). I do not know what to do because I’m in love with her I truly am and I can’t let go. Plz help"
820,"so this guy I went to college with, and whom I was super tight with found this girl, engaged in 4 months, and then like 2 years later married. They had a baby together and everything. Everything looks so pure and fun on social media, but his wife is abusive. She beats him and emotionally manipulates him and puts him down all the time. She has also cheated on him emotionally and as far as we know physically.

So we’ve been talking, and he’s finding a way to get out of this marriage, and I’m trying to be there for him, but he’s been talking about running away with me and being with me and dating me. And not going to lie, I would. I’ve really always felt a spark or something between him and I, so maybe.

This whole thing just is so wild, but I’m really getting some real feelings for this guy..."
821,"My boyfriend and I are both college students right now and we met because we got randomly roomed together in an apartment off-campus. We found out we had some mutual friends and our chemistry was undeniable from the beginning so it seemed really natural when we started liking each other.

I found out early on that he was graduating in December (I'm graduating in May), but at the time, he was looking for full-times everywhere including the city we live in. We kind of agreed back in August to just date in the meantime since we didn't know what it would be like in the end.

In the past 2 months of us dating and him interviewing for companies, we've gotten along really well and spend the majority of our time together since we're dating AND roommates. He's introduced me to his sister and his friends and vice versa. We've never fought and I feel really happy around him. And when I went on a weekend trip with some friends, he called me saying he missed me and how much he cared about me.

When I came back from the trip, he told me he ended up getting the job offer with a company he couldn't refuse. This job is going to be amazing for his career and I was really happy for him, but this job is on the other side of the country.

We talked a few days ago and broke up abruptly because we agreed we didn't really want to try LDR for just a number of good reasons. 1. we both had really bad past experiences with LDR. 2. I don't want him to feel like I'm holding him back in this new chapter of his life while I'm still studying in school. 3. He's going to be there for a while 4. I have no intention of moving there

Since then, we've both talked about how we are unsure how to deal with the next few months (October to December): should we keep dating or try to be friends til December? It seems like he is leaning towards friends since we already broke up. He mentioned how he was worried about hurting me if we keep dating until December and is afraid that he will begin to distance himself emotionally. But we've also talked about how difficult it is living together and constantly seeing each other in the same apartment. It's really hard at night when there's only a wall in-between us and I see him every morning. Yeah, I know... I kinda walked into that one dating my roommate.

I want to do whatever would be the least painful thing to do. I haven't stopped thinking about this for the past few days and any advice would be really helpful.

tldr: roommate became my boyfriend but he is graduating in December and we don't want to do LDR. Should we date or be friends in between now and December?"
822,"Hi, so as from the title I've (M24) got a flirty co-worker. Now it's really nothing that crosses any lines, it could even be described as ""overly friendly"" . We've only really worked together once and met a few times briefly. But every time we did meet she's asked me to ""chill"" or see a movie later. Never done much with it as of yet. Cause I know the type, flirty with no Ill intent. ( I assume). The thing is, my gf (24) for a year and a half was my first. In every way. I'm not used to women flirting with me or even being interested in me other than being friends. This co-worker confuses me, makes me wonder about lots of stuff. My girl is great and I love her loads, I should probably just ignore those feelings for now. But what if I keep feeling like this? I've rarely felt a desire to be with someone like this before, and never had since I am with my girl. I don't really know what to do. ( I told my gf about the co-worker and her flirtatious as soon as I could) ."
823,We have all had that one person we seem we just can’t shake.... the chemistry is amazing... they give you the most wonderful feeling in the world..... But deep down we know they not good for us..... Feelings are one hell of drug we can’t just drop and keep kicking..... It always cross our mind Damn if I do ? Damn if I don’t?????  You absolutely can’t help who you love 🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
824,"I haven’t seen her since I was 16. She was 13. I was a absolute jerk to her. I called her names, made fun of her slight stutter, ran away from her, told her she was weird and annoying, and all of that was really only the tip of the iceberg. 

We met a few months back because her older sister is dating my best friend and has been for quite a while. She got obviously super defensive with me and left right after I tried to talk to her.

Days passed, and my best friend invited his friends over to celebrate something where she would be there. This time, I apologized. I treated her so badly when she did nothing to deserve it. I was being mean and spiteful because I could. I’m not justifying my behavior, I went through phases, I guess it all got to my head and she just happened to be the easiest target to let all of that off. I was only 16, that’s old enough to know better, but I’ve moved forward. 

I started hanging out with my best friend a lot. It was always nice to spend time with friends. But if I am being honest, I was desperate to see her again and he was the connection to her. After apologizing, I had hoped to talk to her a bit more. I appreciated her tenacity, and how she’d changed her life so much. Maybe this unrequited admiration was my payback for when I was 16. 

Two weeks ago, we all went to our hometown to visit our families. She got a call from her boss and had to go back earlier than she was supposed to due to sudden work obligations. Since she doesn’t drive, I was very happy to offer her a ride home as we live in the same city. I had over five hours with her, alone. I took this as an opportunity to use this time to show her that I was actually a good guy. In the car, we both were so intent on asking questions about each others’ lives. I asked her out on a date even if I knew the constant bullying in the past would made it hard to trust my intentions. She admitted to me that she had a crush on me, and even though it happened years ago, doesn’t mean she has forgotten but still accepted. 

So we’re going on a date this weekend. I’d do anything to impress her and make her see how serious I am about her/us. The fact that she’d said yes after everything made me realize how worth it she is. It’s not every day you come across a smart, funny, and most importantly forgiving girl like her. 

I know it is going to be hard to build trust quickly, but if you have ideas on how to approach things with her, please don’t hesitate to share them or your thoughts on the whole situation. No need to make any rude comments about how dumb I was in the past, I changed, and I’m proud of the man I became."
825,"He's in an up-and-coming tech startup. He graduated from an Ivy League, moved to Silicon Valley. He makes significantly more money than I do. He's quiet, nerdy, and a little introverted, but that's why I fell for him. 

I come from a small town. My parents are first generation college students, I didn't grow up with a lot of money, and now I'm a college sophomore living off of two jobs. 

When we're together we balance each other out pretty well since our lives are so different. I'm creative and resilient, he's organized and structured. He really enjoys taking me to amazing restaurants that I wouldn't have gone to otherwise (because of the price tag). It's kind of our thing together; we're both major foodies and big fans of adventure.

When it becomes a problem, though, is when I accompany him to work meetings or meet his other friends. That's when I realize how YOUNG I must look to them. 

Every person I've met in his circle went to the best private schools across America. They're math and science driven, working on major thesis's, employed in major tech companies like Apple or Google. It's an entirely different world than mine, and I have a hard time relating to it or feeling like I belong. I can't help but wonder what they think of me. I'm a conventionally attractive, young looking college girl. Sometimes I feel like I look a bit like arm candy, or something. 

Going to these events makes me wonder ... why is he even with me? Me and him together doesn't make sense, by most standards. I have my whole life ahead of me, with so many questions unanswered, while his life is already mapped out. When he talks to his colleagues about tech jargon I can't help but zone out. I want to understand his world and support him, but I don't know how.

I haven't talked to him about this, and I'm not sure how to without sounding super insecure and like I want attention. I guess I have so many questions since he doesn't open up much about his feelings verbally.

What do you guys think? Can a relationship with two people from different academic and economic spheres work out? How can I talk to him about this?"
826,"It’s been months and I can’t lie I’m struggling. I’ve tried everything from therapy to improving my life and as much as that’s helped it hasn’t got rid of it. 

I met someone who honestly was the worst human being I’ve ever met and she managed to hurt me so badly in the space of 5 months that she changed my life forever. So much that my personality is no longer what it was  

How do you move on and recover the person you once were. Because I’m not going to get any help from her 


Thanks"
827,"You'd think it'd just be that easy but she's going through some stuff right now (right now being all the time) so she's gonna be really fucking sad and angry and all that is gonna be my fault. I know this because it happened to my friend a couple months prior with this girl. I know this sounds insensitive, I obviously do care about her and my main goal is to not hurt her even though I don't think it matters what I do.

 I did try to break up a couple of weeks ago and my assumptions were correct, I said that we could wqit a momth and see how I feel then. But I don't think she get's it because she keeps on fucling talking about how scared she is that I'm gonna leave her.

 LIKE I DON'T WANT TO GET SHIT ON BECAUSE I WANT TO PRIORITIZE MYSELF. And also maybe vbe with other people I fucking hate when people guilt you into staying with them holy fucking shit.

Tldr: What the fuck do I do to not fuck up everything."
828,Would you invite a male friend to your house to hangout? Just to talk and watch tv or a movie.
829,"So we have been dating for over a year and a half now. He is my best friend in the entire world and I love him very much. He always supports me, makes me so confident in myself, is extremely respectful, we have a healthy and active sex life and I feel like I can truly be myself around him. I have a connection with him that I don’t have with any of my friends or anything. Basically, this relationship is important to me and so is he.

We do have slightly different political views. Neither of us are super far right or left. Im left leaning and my bf is more moderate/slightly right leaning. We like to argue and have debates all the time; they are almost always civil and even if we get a little too passionate or emotional, neither of us hold it against one another. Its just politics.

One issue that has begun to genuinely offend me though, is his view on transgender people. At the beginning of the relationship, and even until like 6 or 7 months ago, his views were not too harmful. He used to be against the trans movement because “majority are just dumbass kids hopping on a trend” but had respect and support for those who struggled with gender dysphoria and who he deemed as “real” trans people. More recently, his views have spiraled and he’s being saying some extremely concerning things. Plain rude things like “trans people will never be the gender they want. They’re just mutilating their bodies for nothing. The whole movement is just a fetish”. And more scary talk about how all trans people should just “kill themselves or get over it” and that they are retarded are beneath him and other cis people because of mental illness. When I confront him on these extremely ignorant and hateful views he backtracks on what he says and claims I’m just putting words in his mouth and that he shouldn’t be attacked just for saying that alternate methods of medication should be used for trans people. 

I know he sometimes gets caught up in tangents and ends up arguing things that are exaggerations of his actual views. But this bigoted crap keeps coming up more and more often; it doesn’t quite seem like its just an exaggeration even if he claims it is. I love him with all my heart; he is truly my best friend and biggest supporter, but his views on this topic is a lot to bare. I think we’ve crossed the line of “different political opinions”. What he says is so hateful and hurtful and its really hard to date someone and look at him the same way when I know he has those views. But I don’t want to end our relationship over this issue alone because everything else is so perfect between us. I’m not quite sure how to go about this.

Im using an alt account btw because he knows my main account."
830,"I struggle with PTSD, encountered a lot of abuse as a child. I am in therapy regularly, and utilize EMDR often. I feel mostly healed, as healed as I can be. Lead a relatively happy life, and I have close fulfilling friendships with my friends. Just when I'm in a relationship am I completely emotionally detached, it sets in around 4 months in. I am just wondering if anyone else struggles with this, and what they do to try and overcome the numbness. I understand that it's a vulnerability issue and when relationships become more serious and less surface level and fun is when I shut off... I'm looking for tips and tricks to overcome this."
831,"I am currently in a relationship with my now girlfriend for a couple of years now. we are great. we have arguments like any other couple but for the most part our relationship is great. and we have a beautiful child together. the sex is pretty good. i really don’t have any out of the ordinary complaints. 

little bit of a back story:
 i am 100 percent a boob guy. i love a nice ass but i prefer boobs 10/10 over the booty. my ex girlfriend has some perfect huge boobs while my current girlfriends has virtually no boobs but a big booty. 

now, i have no intentions of reaching out to my ex nor have i since we broke up. 

my current girlfriend and i have sex normally. maybe three or four times a week. but there isn’t a day that goes by that i do not jerk off to pictures/videos of my ex that i still have of her great body. is this normal? does any one else do this? i have been doing this for quite sometime now but stumbled upon this reddit and decided to give this a try. thank you!"
832,"I (25f) recently started seeing a fantastic guy (26m) however he has an issue with a particular guy friend and guy friends in general. 'Harry' and I went on a few dates then things fizzled out on his end, I was upset and still had feelings for him and we stopped talking. 

Fast forward a couple months I'm back to being friends with Harry and we hang out occasionally. I no longer have feelings for him.

I met my boyfriend and we're talking about our  dating history and Harry comes up. My boyfriend is uncomfortable with me hanging out with Harry one on one and other guy friends as he thinks that feelings will develop on the guy's end. I really enjoy Harry's (and my other male friend's) company and don't have feelings for him. My boyfriend prefers me not to hang out with Harry one on one and other guy friends.

One thing to note is that I hang out with my guy friends at my house, have dinner and play video games. My boyfriend hasn't grown up in my country and you could say he's grown up in a country with more 'traditional' approaches to men and women interactions.

I couldn't find past reddit posts that had comprehensive answers. 

Is his request justified that I don't hang out with Harry one on one? Or hanging out with my male friends?"
833,"Met this girl 3 months back, we became close and and confessed feelings for each other.
We talk everyday either through chatting or calls.
In the space of  3 months we argued twice.
These past few days she has been acting distant, she rarely wants to talk over the phone and she replies chat messages with short simple replies.
I got scared and afraid of being hurt, I decided to to act the same. We went on for days without talking to each other. Eventually she texted me and we had a conversation about the issue.
In the disscusion She complained  that I haven't  been giving her enough care and attention and I also acted as if I didn't care about our relationship. She also complained of the spark slowly fading between us.
I promised her that I'll  change, be more vulnerable, show her more affection &amp; attention.
I'm giving my best (IMO) but she's still acting distant.
I'm confused.
Although she just started a new job ( it might be the reason) I also started a new job (a month earlier)
I think I care about her. We are both stubborn 
Should I leave this sinking love boat or hold on ?
She's actually the first girl I've gotten intimate with and I like her"
834,"Hey! 

This is a 3 date with Alexandra

She is 17 and in that age girls wants to have fun. 

Your probably thinking sex is fun so why not have her over and do it. I’m not thinking about it but 
rather doing activities to have fun instead

Any suggestions?"
835,"So I have been living in Location A for over 6 years now. I’m originally from Location B. I moved to location a with an ex of mine that I was with for almost 9 years. We broke up in 2018. I immediately requested a transfer from my job back to my hometown in location b. A year and a half goes by after my break up, then I met someone new. Things have been going well with her and I and I believe I am falling for her. This past week I was informed that my transfer request is pending and that it will most likely happen if I accept it. I am torn because I met somebody who is truly awesome and makes me happy, but I want to be back home in location be because that is where all my friends and family are. The distance between location a and location be is about eight hours. Any advice would help."
836,"So basically my SO is super amazing. She is so determined and smart. Anything she puts her mind on, she can do it. Well she started working at a local bank in our small college town. She wants to continue to work there for 5 years, when I ask about 5 she says she wants to establish herself, then go do something else. She isn’t sure yet maybe Law School or go work at a larger company. The thing is, I have no spine. So early in our relationship, she always told me she wanted me to do whatever I wanted. That I shouldn’t plan my career around her. How she wanted me to do me. 

But then later, she graduated with her bachelors in 3 years. now getting her masters at the same college. I just thought we’d move somewhere larger whenever we both graduated. But then she mentioned that she wanted to be there for 5 years. I kinda resisted it, always using the words. “If we stay here”. Because honestly I could see myself staying at the college for 5 years and getting like a PhD. But it was never my main option. It just formed that way because I was trying to please her. Which is so shitty by me. I guess trying to avoid a fight. But I don’t have to get 3 degrees from one school, academic incest. 

So now we are in an awkward place because I started expressing how I wasn’t 100% sure on what I wanted to do and how 5 years is a long time. She got mad at me about how she can’t adjust her plans for mine because I don’t have any yet. But I’m working on it. How she established a plan and now it’s that way or nothing. How she can’t transfer anywhere, even though this bank has branched in bigger cities. I know it’s my fault for not communicating what I wanted out of the relationship. But everything just changed so fast when he graduated and then started working and getting her masters. I love her so much, I want to be together forever with her. But I feel like she also isn’t budging with me and that’s it’s a one way street. That I’m getting walked over.

Edit: I’m in computer science (surprise)"
837,"Ok, so I've been seeing this guy since the end of June, we were going out on dates, etc. We were taking it slow and just talking, because I'm studying in a different city an hour away and since I got a job in the summer, time became pretty limited. Anyway, things have escalated in mid September when we became a bit closer, we're not officially in a relationship yet, but it's been about a month since we're acting like we're in one. He met my friends and they all told me that he seems to really really like me. The last time he was over I found out that he was still talking to his ex, I didn't find out from him, it was just some notes I stumbled upon from 8-9 months ago (didn't see the date until he showed me).  He told me that we started dating (been talking to each other since May) in June, because she left to another country for the summer and he thought that that will be the end of their interactions (they've been on and off for quite some time, told me that it was mostly a shitshow and it's been about a year since they broke up). But she came back and still wants to talk to him. He doesn't really resist it tho. The time I found out about this, he spent a couple of hours explaining the whole picture to me, swore that I'm his priority and that he wouldn't put that much effort to see me if he didn't like me, when he could be spending time at his summer house by the lake instead (it's his happy place where he spends ALL of his weekends/days off just by himself). Swore that he really likes me (it seems so to me too) and doesn't have the balls to just tell her that he doesn't want to keep in touch with her anymore. Told me that the only reason why he's looking for a job in the city I'm living in and nowhere else is me (got the job a couple of days ago and will start in January). Earlier that day when he opened his messenger I saw that she has texted him the day before and he hasn't replied yet. To conclude this all, according to him, he doesn't really want to talk to her anymore and is basically waiting for things to die down on their own. 
Didn't believe the things he was telling me and he begged me not to push him away.
He is a nice guy and it makes it harder not to believe him.

Now the next day we we're going out on a double date with my best friend and the guy she's seeing. While we were waiting for them in a car, he got a call and just jumped out of the car with his phone in his hand. Came back after a minute or so and after ten minutes of sillence from both of us told me that he didn't pick up and started apologising. He asked me 'just to let him deal with this on his own' . That was like two weeks or so ago. 

About a week ago I told him that I'm really uncomfortable with this whole situation and that he's walking on a thin line. He assured me there's nothing I should worry about.  Yet, as I understand, they're still in contact. 

The past couple of days have been quite hectic for both of us studywise. But he seems distant, we have barely spoken. He had an exam yesterday. While he was preparing for it the day before he was really upset with himself, because he couldn't concentrate and prepare for it. 

Now, as you can imagine, a million things are rushing through my head. I'm feeling hella insecure, especially given the trauma I have from my last RS and I just don't know how to act.

Am I dumb with my rose colored glasses on or is there any chance that he's being honest? Just give me your thoughts and advice, because I really don't know what to do. One part of me wants me to protect myself and tells me to leave, the other wants to stay. 

TL;DR: Guy I'm seeing is talking to his on and off ex and doesn't have the balls to cut her off. And I'm lost."
838,"We are currently on an LDR for 1 year and 4 months since he started his job in Japan last year, but we've been together since 2012.
I just recently found out that back in 2014 he kissed his co-worker, a girl, and it was a girl that I told him about way back then to stay away from 'cause my intuition tells me that his co-worker likes him and that she's flirting with him, but he just got mad and told me that I'm making things up. Well clearly he ignored my warning 'cause it came to a point where they kissed, and that was 4 years ago. He hid the truth from me and pretended it never even happened.
Now I don't know if I should trust him, all along I thought that I met a really nice guy who was honest to me about everything, and now I don't know if they just kissed or was there more like an affair because I can't trust anything he says right now.

All I want is honesty, if he immediately told me about it when it happened maybe I can forgive him, but right now I don't know how many things are he hiding from me. Should I just dump him right now or should I give him a chance to explain or should we work things out?
Because lately I'm feeling kind of rejected and ignored because of this LDR and me finding about this thing he did 4 years ago was the last straw, I really went furious right away because of the deception and lies."
839,"Hey all,

Will keep this brief as I have a bit of reading to do before bed - love a good book before bed.

Long story short, in my city there is a venue (bar) that attracts a lot of foreign nationals (mostly because cheap, and they noticed this so started playing reggaton music (or however it is spelt).

Being a broke student it was a place we frequented cause always good fun, and cheap too, of course. 

Since graduating, we have been going back when meeting up just for the irony more than anything - being able to buy drinks and worrying since in proper jobs now etc etc.

So basically a while back when I was there, ran into this girl, let's just call her Maria - she's Spanish and all that fun stuff (not sure what it is about Latinas, but they're my bread and butter; love that shit.)

Anyway so we're talking and I'm saying that I'm hoping to learn Spanish at some stage, and of course she is here as an au pair trying to learn English etc etc so come to an ""arrangement"" that we'd teach eachother.

Anyway, was a bit drunk so not quite sure if we missed but we were certainly chatting for a while before swapping numbers etc. Then we left and went onto a different venue and the night carried on. 

However me and Maria kept in touch, the odd messages here and there until eventually meeting up and hanging out once or twice. Now I am by no means an expert at this stuff but she was certainly standing close to me the whole time, seemed to looking for excuses to touch my arm / hold on to me etc - so I was thinking she was interested?

Last time we met up (3rd time - other 2 times were just out for a walk or something), she said would be in the city with her friends or something but would meet me afterwards and get a beer somewhere ; but when got there she was with one of her other guy friends, which is cool aswell he's on an exchange or something and a group of them did all the touristy things around the city. When I asked what her plans were for afterwards she just said that she was exhausted from the day and going home - weird I thought? But just went with the flow. 

She invited me out another time to a music event /Street festival with her and a friend but I couldn't attend, this time was before the bar, but because how played out I thought perhaps I was misreading the situation and she wasn't into me at all - so I just did what seemed right and left her he, stopped texting or whatever.

Few weeks go by and now recently she reached back out asking what my plans were for the weekend, but I was away in away for work as it happened, so we kept in contact in text again same as before - I'd ask her what plans were during the week, shaping up to asking her to hang out but it would seem to completely go over her head (perhaps language barrier? Or as I was thinking just not interested?)

However know in the last hour or so, has just messaged saying about some Halloween event that is being hosted in our city saying she was going with a friend, and asked if wanted to go to along with another friend - wouldn't quite call it a double date as such as I'm pretty sure the other friend is saying someone at the moment.

But I'm just thinking, is this just her not interested and me missing the clues?

TLDR: I don't understand women, especially Spanish ones"
840,"This post is intended for men. So, I rather just say “hi” and start dating already. I don’t want to chase harder than I should for it. I feel like if I have to chase for a relationship, then what’s the point of one? Thoughts?"
841,"I understand this isnt a standard topic, but it technically fits. I'm 19 (M) and have struggled with major depression and dozens of other issues regarding trust, social skills, self-worth, confidence, etc. My question is this: I am wanting to make more friends as I only have a small handful of them. But i know that once I get close, at some point, I will have to let them know I'm not doing so hot. I feel like this woukd be selfish of me to do. I want to love others, but they would be trapped with me and my ilness for however long it goes (8+ years and counting). I dont want to burden the people who i choose for friends that are currently blissfully unaware of my issues. I know a good friend wouldn't care that I'm breaking, they would still love me, but I feel like it would be undue stress on thier life and premeditated by myself. I need opinions on this other than my own. Thanks for the help."
842,"My crush for 2 months just got a boyfriend.

I think she's perfect for me, almost too perfect. Shes in almost all my classes, is prettier than any other girl I've met, and is the only girl I've talked to. She has such a bubbly personality and is so cute, I don't want to get over her..

I was trying to build our relationship during those 2 months. I texted her on Snapchat every other day, just talking about random things. In class I try to make her laugh or smile, and we always exchanged glances.

After talking to her a bit more often on Snapchat, she suddenly started to completely ignore me in school. She used to high five all her friends except me. But we always talked on Snapchat, usually me initiating the conversation though. So I though maybe she was just being shy, but I don't know if that's true anymore.

One day, I checked one of her snaps with the private compliment thing, and someone asked ""Got a man?"" and she replied ""No, but I'm kinda talking to someone."" This devastated me at first, but then I thought, maybe she was talking about me. But then I remembered that one guy she was always talking to and was extra playful with.

And then one day, today, I saw them hugging at the corner of my eye. I froze for a moment, and just stood there until he left. I was honestly in shock, like it hadn't hit me yet. But then I saw them hugging again, this time in full view. And again, and again, and I heard her say ""You should just stay here or something,"" and he said ""I have to go to class.""

She never rejected me, but it honestly felt like it. She still doesnt talk to me in class, only rarely if I miss an assignment and she teases me, or when I make a joke and she laughs. I know I can become friends with her if I wanted.

But my question is, should I keep trying? Should I stay friends with her, keep messaging her on Snapchat, and wait for them to break up? Or should I end it, seriously damaging myself, and knowing I won't get another real crush.

I believe I can get over her, but I seriously don't want to, and I don't even know if I should."
843,"She (f22) and me (m23) have been together for about 3 years now. We now live together for about a year and have got a dog and such. She works and I am still studying. All has been well and we still love each other and do things together quite a lot but give one another space to do activities with friends and such more than enough.

Now lately we have been argueing and fighting over a lot of things, probably like once a week as to where we either dont speak or one has to get out of the house and cool off for a bit. This all is settled quite quickly and we say our sorries etc. The fights go over little things like cleaning up stuff or other weird things and I feel like she blames me for most things that go wrong (even if it isnt my fault at all). So now 2 weeks ago we went to a party of a family relative of mine and this girl I knew from a few years back was going to be there as well. I have know this girl from before and we have met a few times and ''dated'' once or twice and I truly liked her to bits but due to distance and stuff she didnt really want to commit and openly told me she was seeing someone and that was about it, we had chats every now and then but that was it. Now I hadnt seen her in 2 years and my gf knows about her etc so she was teasing me that this girl was coming etc. On this party I mainly hang out with my gf and some of our friends. When I saw this other girl enter I got over to her said hi and chatted for a minute just how we are etc the usual things and left as I had to talk to some other people I knew as well. During the night I partied with my friends and gf and notice the girl (lets call her Nina) every now and then with a few of her friends, we make some eye contact every now and then but dont really interact again until she leaves and she waves goodbye to me, I go over and tell her see you next time. After the party when we were in the train back home with our friends and my gf my gf told me that she noticed Nina looking over all the time more or less, something I didnt really notice anyways. 

Anyways since that day I havnt really felt the same overal, im uncertain about a lot of things. About my relationship and what to do and about my feelings for Nina. I know she has a bf and I know she has some difficulties with him as well as he lives quite far from her..  But yeah.. I started doubting my feelings for my gf but all shit is weird as hell.. Im just confused to bits.. 

I hope for some advice on what to do and what not to do. I think I should just talk to my gf about it and she already knows I have been having a hard time mentally lately but yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr    In a relationship of 3 years are having some issues with fights etc, went to a party and met a girl i have sort of dated for little bit and kinda liked back then. my gf knows about her and told me at the end of the night that the girl was looking over to me quite often. Now im confused af and am uncertain about my feelings for my gf. The other girl also has a relationship but its kinda difficult as well.. So yeah SOS help me 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great day, you are awsome &lt;3 ;)"
844,"This will be my first date with my crush, but I still want the freedom to be with anybody and have fun... would going on this date mean I would be leading into a relationship? I wouldn’t mind going out to eat and stuff with him as friends still, but I don’t see a point in dating before college if I’m definitely not gonna do long distance. He didn’t explicitly state it as a date, but I’m pretty sure “inviting me to sushi” means he’s paying and that’s gonna be like a formal date. I know, who wouldn’t want to date their crush, but I don’t wanna have to deal with long distance or my first breakup that I could prevent. What do I do?"
845,"I’ve had a pretty long history with my SO, we’ve had many problems. At this point, I just feel so tired. I feel nothing but this horrible nauseous feeling deep down. I’ve gone back to him so many times, and he’s made so many promises - in short, I was an idiot. He recently admitted to me that he felt he was “missing out” and just pushed it down, but he can’t anymore. And I knew it the entire time, he was only with me because he felt secure. I’m just too tired to really deal with it, if that makes sense? Soon, he’ll be packing his things and moving out, so that isn’t an issue. I just want to vent and get some advice on how to be Ok with this. Thank you."
846,"So, I (20F) think I've got a crush on a girl in my University class. I don't know her well, not even sure if she swings that way.
But here's the thing..
I have a boyfriend. (23M) (1 year) 
I got no idea what this means? So, do I tell my boyfriend I got a crush and hope it'll go away? Do I risk asking the girl in my class if she's interested in the same way? Help a girl out 
(I'm bi-sexual btw)"
847,"I (M18) have known that he's been using drugs with a few of his friends and stuff, sort of classic teenage experimenting with new things, mainly weed, which I'm personally not too bothered about (although personally I don't want to try it). We get on pretty well, he's a nice guy, and our family all gets on well, it's a generic lower - middle class family. 

Just earlier he showed me 10 of these Blue Punisher ecstasy pills that he got for a low price, and he said he was thinking of selling them to younger kids (probably aged 14-15) for higher rates to make some money. I looked up these particular pills and from what I've seen they have &gt;200mg MDMA per pill - I'm not experienced with this sorta stuff, but apparently it's over 3x the dosage of a 'regular' ecstasy pill. It's also been on the news, which says that these particular pills may be dangerous and that they have killed people, although I reckon this is more because people have overdosed.

Anyhow, as well as being worried about him putting kids in danger, I'm also worried about him and his future - I'm worried that he may become addicted to the amount of money that he can make from selling drugs, and I'm also worried of the threat that he could also end up spiralling into a life of drug abuse, and just generally things going very downhill for him.

I know I should probably say something to him about it; at the time I just said that's cool and went to carry on with whatever I was doing, which I do regret now. I'm not sure what I should tell him though, and depending on what happens and how it pans out, if I should ever tell my parents about it. As I said, we all generally get on alright, and I don't want to spoil that dynamic within our family. I also don't want to spoil the relationship I have with him, but I don't want him to make bad choices, especially at this age.

Thank you very much for any comments and apologies if I've worded anything vaguely or badly.

TL:DR - I found my younger brother with ecstasy, planning to sell it to school kids, I'm not sure if I should speak to him / my parents and if so what I should say."
848,"Okay, so I'm an adult male who has never had sex before who is almost 30. I have a coffee date with a woman tomorrow I met on the internet. I am looking to enter a relationship with someone so I don't just want to lead her on thinking I am something I am not since that would be dishonest and probably not the best start. I want to tell her and just accept whatever she says. But, I don't know if there is an optimal time to tell her. Should I just open with it or should I find a better time, like at the end, or even on the 2nd date if the first one goes well. Anyone in here got any solid advice. Also, what are the best questions I can ask to get to know someone? I think we have similar interests so I'm not OVERLY concerned about conversation topics, but at the same time, I'm new to this so maybe I should be a bit prepared.

Edit: I laughed my ass off when I saw how quickly everyone rushed into saving me from myself. I definitely won't open with this. Thank you guys. I actually feel a lot less ashamed of it now after reading your responses.

Edit: Well, thank you guys for all the comments. You guys have made me feel so much better about this and now I'm just excited to go!! :)"
849,"Sorry for the length of the post in advance, I posted this yesterday but only got one response. 

My roommate (F21), lets call her T, and I (F21) were getting ready to go to a party. We've been best friends since childhood and always ask each other for advice on what to wear, makeup, hairstyles, etc. We're both pretty adventurous with clothes and like dressing up, wearing things that make us feel attractive. I put on a really tight risqué crop top, and asked her if it was appropriate.  She made a disgusted face at me, but said it looked okay. I am really insecure about my body so this hurt and I was worried that it was too much, I looked fat, blah blah blah, the general insecurities. I just threw on a coat over it and decided that I liked it and if I felt judged I would just zip up my coat. So she gets ready, I tell her she looks great and we meet up with another friend, lets call them B, to buy alcohol and head to the party. 

At first, it was a great time. I getting tipsy, but by the time I had finished my cup, T was on her 4th or 5th and really drunk. She started saying passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, like backhanded compliments. I just laughed them off because she was drunk. Then the cops showed up, we're obviously over 21, but I knew there was a few 19 year olds there so the house owner's wanted everyone to be quiet and stay put. My friends and I were in a bedroom and T was angry saying she wanted to leave. She was snapping at B and I claiming we are always mean to her when she can do whatever she wants. The owners kept telling her to please be quiet and she could leave after the cops left. She left the room and I went to a different bedroom with my friends who lived there. At this point everyone was drunk and we were having heart-to-hearts about how much we enjoyed being friends with each other. I've always felt unwanted and this really made my night. T came back in, and seemed in a better mood and we danced and socialized with the few others in the bedroom. The cops finally left and T got angry again for some unknown reason, but mentioned she was annoyed that I was talking to boys and she couldnt find one that liked her. B and I told her to maybe to socialize more and that she didn't need guys to like her but said she was leaving. B and I were still having fun so we said we would meet her back at home. 

 The party dies down a bit, and its just B, 2 other friends, and I in the backyard. We were having a conversation about relationships when T comes back. She sits down next to me, and joins in. At some point in the conversation, I bring up how I'm casually seeing my ex, and how I don't know whats going to happen between us. T gets so pissed and keeps saying he's bad for me, an jerk, I would be better off single. I explain that even though I've been upset by him in the past, we were both equally unhealthy to each other and are trying to fix that. She starts yelling that I'm wrong I'm wrong, and I ask her to please explain why because I don't understand why she's so angry about it. Her response is that nobody supports her talking to her ex (also I won't get into it, but her ex was really really bad to her). I *never* told her not to talk to him and I point that out. She agrees with me but is still super mad at yells that she's going home. 

B and I head to my home about an hour later, at which point T has been waiting for us. (Side note: B lives down the street from us, but isn't a roommate). My ex calls me right as I get home and asks me to come over. That annoys T so much and she goes off about how I'm toxic to live with, screaming at me. I still don't know why and I get angry back trying to understand, and she brings up bills. We split all utilities but she has been claiming I owe her for internet. I've been trying to explain for weeks that internet is way less than gas and electricty (which are under my name) and it doesn't make sense to send her what I owe for internet when she will just have to send it back plus more for the bills she owes me. She hasnt ever understood this so that day at work I had written down the math showing how much we each owed for each bill and subtracting what I owed her for internet from what she owes me for the rest. Then she says that I am self-destructive bc of my ex (I have struggled with an eating disorder since highschool), but I point out it's been way before my ex and I even met and shes knows this. At this point she screams she's moving out and I am terrible and need to be ""taken down a notch"". This is all a surprise to me since we've been best friends forever. I found out from mutual friends that both T AND B have been claiming I made a spreadsheet of every little thing she owes me (2 dollars for beer, 3 for toilet paper, 5 for food), when this is not the case AT ALL, and was only for utilities.

I didnt talk to her for a couple days and yesterday she came up to me and apologized for being mean for no reason. How do I prevent this in the future? I keep feeling like maybe my body language or something is saying that I'm stuck-up or have a better than you attitude. The thing is, this isn't the first time this happened to me. A couple years ago another roommate of mine screamed at me and called me a barrage of insults for kissing my boyfriend at a party and ""rubbing it in her face"". I don't know why this keeps happening and feel like I'm the common denominator.

TL;DR My roomate got angry at me at a party over vague things and made passice aggressive comments on my appearance. I don't really understand why she is upset"
850,"Account for this question only, will delete after. 

It’s been nearly two months and there hasn’t  been a day where I haven’t cried. I was really hoping he would change his mind."
851,"Hello everyone. My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years and we have a puppy. We live together and I recently moved to his state to end the long distance. I now live in a cold state which I’m not used to. 

So one huge problem I have with my boyfriend is he has to be a Captain Hindsight or Mr. Logic. It’s infuriating sometimes. Here are some examples: 

We were heading out to dinner with some friends and was quickly walking our puppy before leaving. As we’re doing this, fire trucks pull up. From what we heard, it was a false alarm from this paranoid old LSU that lives in our building. Because of the trucks, I texted my friend/neighbor that if anything is actually real to please save our puppy. My boyfriend comments with “do you really think they’ll come to the 5th floor just to save our puppy if there’s a fire?”.

This happened this morning. I was putting on my boots to go play outside with my puppy. They take a little while because it’s lace up snow boots. I had the other boot on the couch next to my puppy. I didn’t notice she was quietly chewing on the lace while I was focused on the other boot. I never thought to pay attention to her because the most she’s destroyed is a hair band of mine. Once I noticed I got very upset because she actually chewed through the lace and they’re brand new boots. He heard me upset, saw the boot and goes “well, you shouldn’t have left the boot out next to her”. 

Here’s just 2 examples but both times it infuriates me. Admittedly I do get very upset and storm off/usually cry. Like I don’t need to have what’s happening thrown back in my face. The worst thing is, he visibly makes me upset when he says things like that but has ever apologized for upsetting me. He is not the most emotional person and has poor communication skills. 

What can I do about this? I try to talk to him about how I feel but it’s like it goes in one ear and out the other. I’m tired of being made to feel worse when I’m already upset about something. 

TL;DR- my boyfriend is too logical and makes me feel worse about situations when I’m already upset. He also never apologizes. What can I do to get through to him?"
852,"So we’ve been on a few dates and have had a great time with each other. We haven’t had sex but when we started talking about sex she brought up that she found out sometime last year that she got HPV from the previous guy she was with. 
I’ve never had any experience with someone who has had an STD. She told me that I could meet with her Dr to ask any questions that I may have. She told me that i could only get infected if she was having a breakout. Is that true? 
My biggest concern is it worth continuing this relationship with the eventual goal of staying together long term?"
853,"I (M 18) have been dating my girlfriend (19) over a year and half. But recently I discovered, that my feelings are not same ss they were a year ago, actually there may not be any feelings at all. And the fact, that I got crush on another girl ( I tried to date this girl before) is making it even worse. I dont want to hurt my girlfriend, because she really cares about me and is genuinely a nice person. I tried to tell her, the way I feel, but it just made her cry and didnt help at all.

Any suggestions on what to do ?"
854,"So here's me (35M), and I have an awesome girlfriend (40F). And I really mean awesome - she is independent, sure of herself, intelligent, and much more. We have been together for around two years, and she very much wants kids, which is understandable given a) it is a \_very\_ common ambition, and b) her age.

My girlfriend has never hidden her desire to become a mother, and since about half a year into our relationship she has made it clear that she wants to have kid(s) with me. I am of course flattered - not least by her dedication to me. However, I am not sure if I am suited as a father in my current position. 

My background is that from a religious upbringing. This upbringing was neither physically or sexually abusive, but emotionally abusive. By this I mean my parents were loving, but only decidedly within certain (religious) limitations. Were they to choose, they would definitely choose their religion over me and for a period of multiple years they did so. 

This has left me with a broken emotional compass where I am almost never certain what I feel, because my parents' acceptance was always dependent on whether what I felt was considered appropriate by them. I have struggled immensely with this devaluation of my own feelings for many years - decades even - but I am improving. However, I feel there is much more room for me to grow still.

Going back to the topic, this makes me (very) uncertain on whether I am ready to father a child.   
I consider myself to fare pretty well as a person in general, but I am not sure whether this will hold true with increased responsibility, likely sleep deprivation, etc. of child. This is a decades-spanning responsibility!

Concerning my girlfriend, you might ask if I love her? I am not sure. My instinct tells me that I love no one - not even myself (hence my background story). I am working on this, but I am not sure whether this is an obstacle or whether an intent to grow as a person is sufficient.

All in all I am afraid that I will fall short. Fall short for my girlfriend and her ambition to become a mother and not least to a potential child. Ideally waiting some years would be best for me, but obviously not for her. Recently she has sought out conversations about having children, so things are coming to a head soon. 

I am really at a loss here. Should I go ahead with becoming a father and I believe I will grow into a more emotionally practicing individual? Should I leave my girlfriend to pursue her ambition to become a mother without me? Or perhaps some other way exists?"
855,"Going on a first date soon, I was wondering what I should talk about iwht her? Already now a good bit about her due to emailing, but conversation topics I should use?"
856,"TL;DR at bottom

I(23F) had a sexual encounter with one of my friends (22M) who is also my brothers best friend. We were out for the night, but he left his skateboard at our house. When we came home (I live with my brother and another friend) he insisted he help me make my bed. But since I knew one of our friends that was going to crash with me was gonna come back any moment, I offered to walk him out. Once the elevator door closed, he suddenly started kissing me passionately. It was fun, admittedly, and we exchanged a smile before he went on his way out. He dropped me a cute text later, saying he had a fun time, especially at the end. 

The next day he asks if I want to hang out, look at some comic book he bought (I'm a big comic fan). Since my brother and friends were suspicious about me escorting our friend out earlier (he knows the way), I decide to think of a cover-up and head over to his house. Not entirely sure what to expect, I come in and we have some casual chit-chat. At some point I mention the kiss, and how it was nice, and I blurt out that I like him but that I am not looking for a serious relationship now. He agrees and we continue to sit around a bit before he starts making out with me again. This time within closed quarters, things escalate. Not to get too graphic, but we had a fun and exciting time and we both seemed to enjoy it. 

So far, so good right? Well, this is where things start *going south*. 

Afterwards we make some casual conversation again, although this time it is a little bit awkward. There is no cuddling or kissing. I should mention both him and I have recently gotten out of a long relationship. I said we probably both really needed the rebound. I also said I would be up for a sequel if he ever felt like it. When leaving his house I was not sure what to do so I didn't give him a goodbye kiss or hug or hand or anything, just said bye and walked away while he awkwardly stood there in the door. 

When I get back, I send him a text reading: ""that was a fun time hehe"" (*facepalm past me*) and ask him about a meet-up to play games with friends later in the week. He does not respond. I tell him I feel a little weird now. He says same. I hope he doesn't think that I had a bad time with him, so I let him know I did however really enjoy it and that there are no regrets on my part. He does not respond to any of it. After that, we exchange a couple of texts about our meet-up, but his answers are short and response rate is slow. In the end, when our meet-up arrived he decided to stay home and play his game from there. 

Ok, so that is the situation. Currently, I don't want to be too pushy and force him to do or say anything he doesn't want so I am holding off texting him for a meet-up with just the two of us. My question to you is, reddit: what are the possibilities here? Is he being distant? Trying to play me? Freaked out? Wishing that it never happened? Playing hard to get? I'm not looking for a relationship with this guy, but since he is an important friend to me I don't want to screw this up. Any advice is welcome!

*Help me from making mistakes and ruining my friendgroup please*

TL;DR: had sex with a good friend and now he is being distant, I'm wondering how to find out without pressuring him

Oh, and before you guys mention it... I did tell my brother. Had a good laugh and he even offered to be my pawn if necessary."
857,"So, first and foremost, I dated this girl for about three weeks a couple months ago and I found out she was incredibly abusive and manipulative (a lot of violence and threats of self-harm if I did something she didn't like). So I broke things off and blocked her, but shortly afterwards she filed a Title IX complaint with the school against me for sexual assault (even though we never had sex). 

Because of how long this process has been going on for, I wound up liking and asking out this girl, who she said yes. The first date went well, but now that there's a second date planned and coming up, and I feel like I should tell her that I am currently facing false sexual assault allegations but I'm not sure how to go about it without freaking her out or scaring her off.   


Any advice?"
858,"Copied from TIFU, since I also want some advice.

I'm still stressing out so apologies for any mistakes here. Maybe some background: in a previous LDR this girl was cheated on (from what she told me).

Story:

Me and my LDR were talking casually when she asked me if I would still love here if she was fat (kinda jokingly). I responded that I'd always love her and that I want her to be healthy because of that. Funnily enough, 1 second after I sent that message she said me a hint that that was the right answer. So far so good.

Then I told her like 'damn, look at me being a pro BF', to which she responded that I just have a lot of experience. I told her that I didn't, then she said 'what about all your baes?'. Up until this point I think everything was said jokingly, but she expected me to just say 'no' I guess.

Instead, I asked her 'Are you jealous \*insert smirk smiley\*'. She asked 'Should I be?'. Now here comes the fuckup. I told her 'Just a little, healthy amount' because I thought what she asked was if I wanted her to be jealous and to be honest, I kinda get jealous when hearing stories about what happened before I met her. She however (of course) meant 'Should I be jealous because there areother girls?' Then she was kinda pissy and told me that she expected me to say I had none, not that she should be jealous of them.

Now here comes the real fuck up. I thought she meant jealousy of people I was into in the past (my exes) and not current girls. So I told her ""Oh, I thought you were talking about my exes"". This is when she got really mad and now she thinks I meant to say that she should be concerned about my exes and that I still have feelings for them. She told me she's fucking done and she blocked me on whatsapp, but not on fb, snapchat and iMessage (so far). She's not returning any of my calls. Kinda freaking out because fuck, I'm an idiot for not realizing what she actually meant and I do really fucking like her.

I have been kinda blowing up her phone which I guess is not the smartest thing to do but fuck, I don't know what to do to be honest. It's just so stupid because there is nobody else in my life, I'm not interested in other girls, I'm just slightly retarded when it comes to interpreting things.

She did have to pull an all nighter from monday to tuesday, then slep very badly so that might have added to this. Fuck. 

TL:DR : Girl asked if she should be jealous of my baes, I thought it was exes, as I'm the jealous type I said a little, she thought I meant I still had feelings for one of my exes and blocked me on one app.

What do I do? I guess spamming her is not the way to go?"
859,"Hi
I got married 3 years back and had difficulty having sex but three months back we finally had sex but my husband is not able to ejaculate in me because he masturbates and cant feel anything when he penetrates me. He stopped masturbating two months back but the problem is still the same. First 3 years I had problem having sex and now he lost his sensivity due to masturbating. We want to have kids. If anyone of you had similar problem and couldn't ejaculate, how did you overcome it?"
860,"I ( M16) and my girlfriend (F18) have been together for 4 months, we love each other and we have AMAZING chemistry.
Only problem is that she is my first but I am  not hers which means that she had hookups,relationships etc where as i did not, and if i stay in this relationship with time i’ll feel like i’ve missed something down the line and i’m worried about that. For now I don’t feel anything towards other girls but not gonna lie I am curious about experiencing other people and just hooking up with someone else ( even if I don’t feel attracted to them).

I can either stay in this relationship and be with her and we get married etc which will be amazing other than the whole me not trying others. Or i can break up with the girl that i love just to try others.. and then probably regretting it.

Both choices will make me regret something and I don’t know what to do..

TL;DR: my gf is my first while i’m not hers, we love each other, but the only problem is my curiosity about trying others and hooking up etc"
861,"I had been dating this girl for about two years and we were living together when her cousin came to stay with us for a week. We got along great then as she likes rock climbing so I took her to a climbing gym and had a great time. We also would stay up late playing Rocket League together. She left at the end of the week and I remember thinking that she was really cool and neat.

A year later and my then-girlfriend and I broke up and about three months after that I ran into her cousin at a local coffee shop and we ended up making plans to go climbing together again. We did and then she came back to my place and we played Rocket League the whole night before cuddling on the couch watching King of Queens reruns (we both love Kevin James and I was thinking of doing a Paul Blart marathon with her).

Anyway, can I officially date her? Is this weird? I have already met her parents as I went on a ""family retreat"" with my ex to a resort in Montana where I met some of her extended family. This is the most confused I've been ever!"
862,"I have gone through depression off and on over the past year and a half, sometimes getting to the point where is wondered if the world would be better without me, and worrying that I was a burden to those around me. The only reason these thoughts have not been carried out is because I thought of this person, and how it would hurt them if I did. I really want to let them know what they mean to me and to thank them for all they have done for me, I am just not sure how."
863,"I've been seeing a girl i met online for a few months now. She is only in the area for a little longer before she goes back to her home state to finish college. Because of this, she told me she was only looking for something casual while she was in the area.   understand and respect that, and don't want to push the issue and risk ruining what we currently have. However i have recently run into the following issues. 


First and foremost. I have WILDLY fallen for her. We have everything in common she checks every single box on my ""ideal partner"" checklist. She is amazingly beautiful and affectionate in all the right ways. 

Secondly, and more importantly. She been giving me wierd vibes lately. She casually mentioned me taking a trip to her place around st pats day next year to party with her and her friends. (Fairly long ways away, ~1000 miles, but i would definitely not be opposed). Also,  we were doing the deed last week and I am 80% sure I heard her moan out ""i love you."" My heart did a backflip. 

In summary, im REALLY lost as to what I should do. I cant figure out if I'm just fabricating her feeling in my head or not. I would LOVE to be in a relationship with her, but I'm terrified of scaring her off if I'm wrong. A relationship with her would mean a long distance relationship for AT LEAST a year or two until shes done with college. I could do that, especially for someone like her, but i dont know her feelings on it."
864,"  

I need your overall perspective of the situation and advise on what I should do. 

I never really dated much, my family moved from CA to TN when I was in high school so I really didn’t have a chance to explore. I then joined the military and focused on that while I was trying to complete my degree also. It was hard to get in to any relationships. I had a couple hook ups, but that was about it. After I was done with my military career and done with college I moved back to TN (small town) no one really sparked my interest. I am gay and finding someone in a small town in TN is very hard. I then joined an a dating site where I met this girl… she messaged me, but at the time I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to talk to anyone or not, I ignored her, and closed the account. I then re-opened the account and didn’t really think much of the girl, she then found me again and wrote something like…I’m over here liking you and you’re over there ignoring me”. (She lived in CA and I in TN) from there on, we never stopped talking. We would FaceTime regularly and text constantly. After a couple months I really wanted to get to know this girl a whole lot better, so I decided to plan a trip out to CA and spend time with friends and family I hadn’t seen in a while (mostly I wanted to meet her in person, but didn’t want to seem desperate) I rented a car and hotel in LA and since the day we first meet in person ( the day I arrived) we were inseparable. After a great week I had to go back to reality. We continued talking and everything was great. After a couple months I wanted to make the move to show her I was really interested in taking this to another level, so I then looked for a job in CA and found a great one within weeks and two months after visiting I was planning my move to CA. 

Fast forward a couple months after my move, everything was going great, I would buy her flowers at least once a week and would try to have a getaway at least once a month, where we would leave the city and just spend time together. I would take her to fancy dinners around town. It was all great until we had a really big fight over something small. We stopped talking and she blocked me from social media. I was heartbroken, I had made a huge move and left my family behind for her and it was easy in my eyes for her to just stop talking to me.

I didn’t look for her and respected she needed her time/space. I went on and did me, I hung out with friends from childhood. I started going out and meeting new people. I did also start talking to another girl. We seemed to be pretty cool and would talk for hours and it seemed like time would fly. Then months later, ex decided to unblock me and re-add me on social media and sends me a snap. Trying to ask how I’d been and how life was. I told her the truth, life had been rough at first, but it seemed as if I found my place and I was having lots of fun. I also told her I was talking to someone else and didn’t know where that was going, but we were just friends and hadn’t established anything yet. She then decided to show she was still very much interested in me and calling me again all the time and texting me and trying to see me again. I gave in and stuff happened. I told the other girl the truth and let her go, I don’t like playing with any one’s emotions. So I stopped that. Me and ex/again girl started taking things a bit more serious, but she threw me talking to this other person in my face all the time. 

Fast forward a couple months later, she was sleeping over my studio and a text from that girl I had been talking to while I and she were not, came in and she lost it. She thought me and this girl continued talking, which we were not. We stopped talking, until I proved to her I had not. Fast forward a couple months later and now we are living together (at a new apartment), but I hold a lot of resentment/grudges and mixed in with my insecurities, we fight a lot. This Monday I sent her a text, since we can’t seem to have a reasonable conversation, I sent her a long text explaining I was tired (she had been threatening me with leaving the apartment) I told her if she wanted to leave, I would no longer try to stop her and that I was tired of all the fighting and the way she treated me. When I got home, she was being nicer and has been these past couple days. 

Here is where I need your opinions/advice….

We have been “dating for over a year” and when I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend she said No, she would rather continue to take it slow and continue dating me (but yet decides to move in with me). 

She has called me, dumb, stupid, bitch, in front of her family and friend’s (While she was drunk) but it hurt and humiliated me.  

When I try to touch her, hug, or kiss her she pushes me away. (Her excuse is something about her passed, with slot of abuse) I am patient and I tell her and show her I am there, and she could talk to me rather than make me feel like I am not worth it or she isn’t interested in me. 

She has access to my phone (since she believed I was cheating, when I know I wasn’t) and I don’t have any access to hers, and gets mad every time I ask who she is texting or calling. (She says “I am not you”)

I still to this day, buy her flowers weekly and make her breakfast in bed on the weekends. 

She is always tired and never wants to go out with me, but as soon as a friend or family contact her, her tiredness or hurting seems to go away. 

She had an accident where she was hospitalized for a month, I would be there daily to help her try and shower, wipe her ass when she couldn’t and bring her food since she hated the hospital food, but when her friends or family would go, she would make it a huge deal about me going. She would tell me if I showed up we were done. (at one point I thought maybe she is bringing in another girl, so when she insisted I not go, I still went and it was a friend whom she said it was going to be) I just don’t know why she would fight me for me not to show up.

Please let me know you opinions!"
865,"Idk if this is the place to post this, if it's not I'm sorry.

My ex and I broke up months ago and are NC but today I went to the doctors to be referred to therapy to cope with the trauma from his abuse and help build up my esteem so I won't fall into this pattern again. The doctor said more than once that he suggests that I, at least, make a report against my ex but I know it will drag up so much crap and I just want to move away from this. The problem is I know he was abusive to his ex before me too and the doctor made a point that he will do it to the next girl and I'm conflicted.

I don't have solid proof of some of his abuse and his dad is a lawyer (not in my country). I feel like if I even report this I will be causing trouble for myself and my family. I don't know what I should do?"
866,"22m here. Hi there! I'm here to share something I never thought I would publicly state. Ever since I was a child, I don't feel I'm close to anyone. I had a very tough childhood and I'm pretty sure no other child has been in a situation like that. It's related to my family and how strict, ignorant, and unsupportive they are. Anyways. Because of that, I mentally grew up too soon. What I mean by that is I had real concerns and issues in the age in which the biggest concern should be not losing your favorite toy or missing a cartoon episode. That affected me socially in a very negative way. I wasn't able to fit in any group at school or any other place because their normal speech was like ""meh"" to me. It's not because I felt like I was smarter or they were inferior to me. So I literally grew up with NO ONE by my side. No friends at all; obviously that's why I'm here.
Now romantically speaking, I have never been in a relationship before. It could be related to me not being socially active. And also because I have never met a girl who I really liked.  The majority of girls here in my country are only focused on how they look, feeding their ego, and getting the best validation available. I always feel like I want to be with a girl who knows what ""suffering"" is, because if she did, we would understand each other very easily. I can't get rid of ""the one"" idea, and I doubt I would. I'm from a middle eastern country and things here are different than west. It's not a simple and easy task to approach a girl and start a conversation, because 90% of the times it will fireback. I'm really serious and it's not me being a misogynist. The majority of the girls here are silly and ridiculous, the thing that turned guys to be silly too in order to have the girls. It's been 22 years and I have no girlfriend nor a close friend with whom I would speak something like this. It's been 22 years of me being no one's priority. It's been 22 years and I'm still virgin. It's because I feel like sex is originally a way of expressing emotions and love, but I never had emotions and love for a girl. It's been 22 and I feel like I'm buried alive. I feel like I was born in the wrong time and the wrong place. 
This song would explain almost everything ( https://youtu.be/GJY8jJkDoMY )
I'm sorry if this is off topic or this is the wrong place to post such thing, I'm just in a deep need to know that there's somebody who understands what's I'm going through."
867,"I’m a few months younger than my gf and she thinks when she turns 18 it’s wrong for us to continue dating 

She wants us to put a pause on things for a couple months when she turns 18 until I also turn 18.

I think she’s being dumb and it’s completely reasonable for me to continue dating her at 17 years old only for a few months. (Neither of us have had premarital sex and don’t plan on it but we do make out)

I’d love your thoughts on this PREDICAMENT"
868,"Not sure how to phrase any of this, and first time posting, so im just gonna lay it out there. 

So we are both 27. I work for myself and have a unique work/living situation with a roomate. She had her own apartment. She lost he job at a big retail company about a 8 months ago and was on unemplyment for a few months. 

Her lease was up and she had a new apartment lined up about 5 months in and was able to afford it with unemployment.  I agreed she could come stay with me while they readied her new apartment, so a week or two was the though. Somehow after she moved in, she ended up missing the move in date and has been staying with me since, still unemployed. 

She took a part time job than promptly quit it losing he uneployment. Shes been applying for jobs online on indeed and thats it, no real followups, no in person applications. But still no job. 

Heres where I’m starting to get miffed. I dont make a ton of money, and now im supporting both of us with no end particularly in sight. Im falling behind on my bills, i spend twice as much on food and my vices(smokes, ect)  plus hers. She doesnt have money to chip on for rent on top of it and its really putting a strain on me finacially. 

And lastly, since shes moved in: sex life has almost disappeared, not for my lack of trying. 

I could use some advice here.  Dont want to just kick her out/break up, but im starting to wear down."

870,"So maybe you saw my post before and know I have a high libido, I would love to have sex every day easily but he is fine with a month. 

I tried again to talk to him before our weekend. It's my birthday and we have a hotel room for the night. I am still concerned that he can't satisfy me at all and he doesn't want to touch me. When I tried to talk to him again starting with praising what is great and just mentioning something that is not so great he got mad and ignored me. After I tried it again he told me that I am addicted to sex and I should seriously seek for help, maybe there is a therapist who could help.

It seriously hurt my feelings and all my confidence is destroyed. I don't know what to do at this point. I lost all my lust and I just don't even want to see him at all. 

Am I really addicted? Should I really go to a therapy?"
871,"We were both friends for a month or so. She gave some signals that she liked me.  

While walking home from hanging out she confessed to liking me (while slightly crying). She also said that she was afraid her crush on me was going to mess with her grades.

We were texting a day later and she we struck up a relationship. Both of us had never been in a relationship before. 
Out of the blue, she texted me how intense my feelings were for her so that she could adjust.
I replied, “I know for sure that you’re pretty cute, but otherwise I’m not so sure about my feelings.”
Looking back, I wish i didn’t say that because it wasn’t 100% true, I like her a lot, not just for her looks.
Suddenly, she texted me saying that she wasn’t even sure if she liked me or even if she liked girls in general (she had always seemed gay before).
She abruptly ended the text conversation saying she had to go. We texted later that night though, but we didn’t bring up our “relationship”.

The next time we saw each other in person, she told me that she though she made it pretty obvious that she liked me. We both told each other some moves we made on each other when we were both friends. But whenever I told her some mixed signals she gave me, she wouldn’t say anything.
She always kept asking, “Why do you like me?” 
I said “You’re cute and I like your personality.”

Then I said “I feel like you don’t like me as much.” 
She paused then said “I am attracted to you... in a romantic way,” in a quiet voice, “...and I’m comfortable being in a relationship with you.”

The next few days we acted just like normal friends though. But, she did make plans to go over to my home a few times that week.

Okay, so here’s where the mixed signals come in:

We were video chatting and she was drawing a nude person and said “This is so weird, drawings naked person with your friends.” 
Note how she said friend.

Now I’m confused. Please give me your advice on this situation, I would really appreciate it.

TLDR: I recently started a relationship with a friend of the same gender and she called me her friend (read the full post for context)."
872,"My ex and I are best friends today, though I have MANY reasons to believe that he wants to be more. We’re 24 and dated between the ages of 15 and 21. The relationship ended at my hands because I 1. was losing attraction and 2. felt curious about other people (we were each other’s first everything). We tried to give our relationship another shot 6 months later but I realized I no longer felt anything for him. :(

I feel so, SO blessed to say that he was happy to be friends. It’s been almost 3.5 years since we broke up and we still hang out at least once a week 100% platonically. Although I’m ecstatic to still have him in my life, I do get sad that it has to be like this. Honestly, our relationship was great and he was an amazing boyfriend and human being. I was an IDIOT for falling out of love. Plus I greatly, greatly miss having a boyfriend and doing cute relationship things. I know that attraction has to be there and I just don’t have any for some dumb ass reason.

If there is a way to fall back in love with someone and see them how you used to see them, please let me know. It can’t be impossible. Like I said, he didn’t do anything in particular to change my feelings; they changed all on their own. I would love to get them back."
873,"I’m (22M) single and the dating apps aren’t working. I go to a coffee shop once a week and see people there but never talk to anyone. I also don’t know how to talk to people at bars... I spoke to a cute bartender a few times but that’s it. 

But I don’t want to strike up a conversation with someone who doesn’t want to talk... but how do I meet people??"
874,"My long term girlfriend (4 years together with the last 8 months living under the same roof) cheated on me while on a vacation trip abroad with friends. I was stressed at work and very busy with doing paperwork for a visa that would allow me to live with her next year. We kept in touch at least once a day by text and sending pictures here and there and updates about our day despite the time difference. However one day she sent me a few texts and a ""sexy"" picture that was basically fishing for a compliment or initiating something, but in a very indirect way. I was busy out doing paperwork with a friend, so I foolishly just sent a thumbs up to acknowledge the messsages (I'm pretty daft sometimes...). Two hours later, once back home, I tried to re-initiate conversation by sending a video of our cat (I'm not a charmer at all, I know...). I think this was the night she cheated on me. Next day she text replied to the cat video, and we went back to exchanging texts as usual, dishing out the occasional compliment or loving emoji here and there. Later still, she stopped texting for 2 days, I was the last to send something. I did not think much of it and I was exhausted, happy to have time for myself. She definitely cheated during those days. Then later, back to normal, sending couple things like pictures of us and complimenting each other. Then she was back home from her trip.

To cut it short, I finally had my suspicions later as she was emotionally distant, something was definitely wrong, I looked for signs of cheating, then confronted her and made her confess. She was defensive, blamed me, told me I neglected her etc. Am I right to think that not replying to her sexy picture ONCE is an INSANE reason to cheat, and is just an excuse?? She's still in contact with the guy she cheated me on with, and is actually thinking of starting a relationship with him now but tells me she is confused and can't chose between me and him, I should definitely just break up with her for good right?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : Girlfriend cheated on me and is blaming me for neglecting her, using me dismissing a text as an example. I am I right to think this is bullshit and I should dump her without looking back?"
875,"This may be a little long. We've been together more than an year.  I love her and I want to marry her in the future. Thing is, I have ADHD, tend to forget things more than I want, and a little germophobic. I know I'm not easy because of these things. I'm working to get better. She has 2 cats (they're not indoor cats only), in the beginning I didn't like them sleeping with us, but I'm okay now as long as they don't sit on my pillow. They like to drink from the bathroom faucet, At first I complained about it because my GF reeinforces this attitude, now I just clean the faucet, and doing  this irritates her. SHe complains about it. She complains that I take to long to wash the dishes (but I don't let the water running nonstop). Complains about me washing my hands too mush. About the noise  when I chew. She even complains when I decide to clean the house.She kinda like to boss around. I don't like it. When I say I'm going to do it, I will. But she always wants me to do it right now. She can't wait a bit. And she always wake up in bad mood. We talked about it, she's trying to be better...She complains if I ask questions. When she comes to talk, I try to find some logical solution to the problem, but this infuriates her. Then, when I'm fed up, I just silent her and agree with her, since she does not want my input.

We don't live together yet. I stay one week with her, another at my city, alternating.I help her with bills. Some time ago I discovered she had 8k in debt with the bank, even before I told her if she needit I could lend her...Last week she was I getting nervous ans stressed about it, and I ended  up paying moost of the debt. So she could be more relaxed and pay me without interest.

My mother's health are not so good, just discovered she has  fibromyalgia , and I'm helping her out. My dad kind  screwed up  with her, so she's lost confidence on him, when she needs to go to doctor, most of the time she feels more secure if I go.

This week I was with my GF. Last night GF and  I went to sleep in a bad mood because she was angrily replying to me. I did nothing to her. After that  I junt went to bad. In the morning my mon called me to ask i I could go with her to the doctor, I decided to no go, but GF told me that every problem that appears,  always falls on me to solve it. Even when I'm at GF' house That my mon has people there to help her, while GF's mother lives alone. (GF has 3 sistes and live in the same city as her mother. I'm an only child, and mon  told me she feels nervous around my father, they've been fighting a lot). So I'm not supposed to answer  calls from my home, apparently.

I told her my mon is not in a very good place right now, she's having panic attacks, anxiety...I HAD these. She helped me when I was in a very dark place, so there's no way I'll refuse to help her when in need.So, I waked up early and decided to clean the house (GF' house) and she complains that I'm cleaning it today. I got pissed. Went back home and forced my father to go with my mon to the doctor, even when she didn't want.

What the hell am I supposed to do? It seems that everything I do irritates her. I love her, but I'm having doubts in being with her.

Sorry for the long textm and english. Not my first language."
876,"We broke up for a month. Then last week started seeing each other and sleeping together again. We still haven't really talked about everything, but we both want to make it work and be together.

I know I can't be mad about what he did when we were apart, however I can't stop thinking about if he slept with anyone. I'm very positive he did. He has told me multiple times that sex is just sex for him, and love is something different. Is it unreasonable to want to know what happened? I don't need all the details, I just want to know if it was a stranger or someone he used to sleep with and I'll have to see in the future, and if he used protection. 

I know it's not cheating. And when we were dating, I had complete trust in him that he wouldn't stray. My mind is just jumping to so many conclusions about what happened. Should I ask or should I drop it?"
877,"Hi all. Throw away because my boyfriend knows my other user.

My (26f) boyfriend (29m) is upset because I am going on a vacation with my female (26f) friend. She brought the idea up to me on Monday. I am
not sure if I’ll be able to go yet (work) but I gave my boyfriend a head’s up anyways.

He got really upset. This happened on Monday and he’s been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. I planned to go away for my birthday with him early next year (we planned this months ago, mind you) but apparently he’s still upset because “I do really cool and spontaneous things with my friends”. 

He’s always been jealous of my male friends but now he’s jealous of my female friends too? What gives? I sent him a message last night of how I’m tired of walking on eggshells around him and I feel like I can’t have a life outside from him. He gets to do whatever he wants but whenever I have a night out/idea of something that doesn’t include him, he goes off the deep end. Since sending that text, we haven’t spoken in 14 hours. 

Did I do something wrong? Should I sympathize with him? I literally see zero problem with going away with a female friend. A friend he’s met several times at that. A friend I have had for years. I love him a lot but this just screams of immaturity to me, especially since he doesn’t even have the decency to have a full conversation about how he feels.

tldr: Boyfriend is upset that I am going away on a spontaneous trip with a female friend. We were supposed to go away for my birthday early next year but apparently that isn’t close enough."
878,"My ex girlfriend or two years has decided it'd be fun to drag my name through the mud, for some context; she broke up with me because she no longer saw a future with me due to me not being a Christian. After she broke up with me we tried to remain friends (unsuccessfully) she would tell me about random dudes she was trying to sleep with and even once called me crying because she got high and fucked a guy 5 years older than her. Anyway (sorry off topic)

 I offhandedly mentioned that at one point whilst we were dating I started daveloping feelings for one of my friends, because of these feelings I told my friend I needed to take a step back and they were understanding. Then my ex imploded in on herself like a dying star, she called me a cheater, told me to kill myself, told me she still loved me? It was weird.. but I thought ""eh she has a boyfriend I have a girlfriend what does it matter""
Boy was I wrong! She has now told everyone we've ever been friends with that I cheated on her and a lot of them have sent me lovely messages telling me what a horrible monster I am for cheating on her. I even got a text from her grandmother telling me how disappointed she in me.

Basically I just wanted to know if you have any advice for dealing with this situation?"
879,"Jane and I are both women in our mid-30s. We first met when we were in 7th grade and have been best friends since then. It's cliched, but she's basically the sister I never had. We've been through thick and thin together, I had a rotten home life and was always welcome at her house to escape mine, she's always been there for me, she's written resumes for me that got me jobs, and was just great to be around. We've never had any problems until this past year.

Jane can get bitter sometimes because she's never really dated or had a boyfriend and I've had lots of relationships, so she gets really judgmental about my boyfriends. She also has a little bit of a superiority complex because she has a masters in history and works at a museum and I work as a receptionist in a doctor's office.

I met a 22-year old guy named Mark the other year and let's not talk about the age difference. He was in the army, is really mature for his age, and I look a lot younger than my age so it doesn't matter.

Of course it mattered to Jane though and the first thing she said after I told her about him was ""You know he wasn't even born when we met in middle school?""

But Mark and I really clicked, we have all the same interests, same sense of humor, like the same games and movies, etc, and he ended up moving in with me after about a month, which Jane said was really stupid since he didn't have a job and couldn't pay rent and was just using me. But again, we're the ones in a relationship, and I was happy to support him until he was on his feet.

They never liked each other. Their politics are different, Jane is really liberal and Mark is very conservative. Mark's sense of humor is to get people riled up, so he joked about how she ought to teach kids the real reason why the Civil War started, she asked what he meant, the war started because of slavery. Mark said that was wrong, he should know since his family were poor farmers who didn't even own any slaves but still fought for the South for states rights. But he was a little serious too since that was true about his family. She doesn't like his views on immigration or global warming or international politics, so he was able to 'trigger' her on all that as well. She finally asked if she and me could hang out without him and when we did, Mark would call or text me every half hour just to make sure I was okay, or to let me know what our plans were going to be later on. Jane thought that he was being controlling because if I didn't immediately reply, he would keep on calling or texting until I did, I said he was just being concerned and it was sweet. Mark thinks she's a snob and probably in the closet since she's never had a proper boyfriend. I don't really care, but just kind of nod whenever he complained about her since I had to live with him. Basically, they don't like each other and that didn't matter in the end since she had to move out of state for a new job. We would continue to talk or email about once a week, but life gets in the way and that tapered off until learned I was pregnant.

Mark was really excited, I was excited, and even Jane was excited when I told her and basically asked her to be the baby's aunt/godmother. Then we started talking a lot more often and began making plans for her coming to visit after the baby was born.

Then I discovered Mark had been cheating on me for a few months, apparently when he would go to visit his family in his old state, who didn't even know I existed or that he was going to be a father.

Jane was furious on my behalf when I told her and she got on her high horse, which I agreed with at the time. She called Mark a man child, said he had just been using me, said that he was way too immature to be a father, and that I needed to do all these things to get him verified as the father to get child support, and she would find resources/support for future single-moms like me, and that she would take time off if I needed her support now. I told her that could wait, she couldn't really take time off from her new job yet and I was getting support from my coworkers. She made it REALLY clear she hated Mark and at the time, I really did too. She didn't quite say ""I told you so"" but I got the impression she'd expected something like this to happen.

In the summer, my coworkers threw me a baby shower. The pics were posted online, Jane saw them, and was upset I hadn't let her know it was going on, she would have tried to come or at least sent me a gift. I figured since she didn't know my coworkers, it would have been weird if she'd come and she had hinted she was knitting a baby blanket so why would I ask her to buy another gift?

And then a week later, Mark showed up at my door to apologize. He explained he had gotten scared, that he had gone back to his ex to make sure things were one-hundred percent over between them, that he hadn't told his family because he knew his father would be furious at him for abandoning me, and that he really did want to be in me and the baby's life. He had gotten a job and would help contribute around the house. I know a lot of people will think I'm stupid but I didn't want to be a single mom. I didn't want to have to beg for help or deal with dating guys who would be turned off by my having a kid. And even though I was mad at him, I was willing to give him another chance.

But I knew Jane would never let me hear the end of it if she found out we were back together. Like I think she would be REALLY mad to the point where she would stop talking me. And Mark found my text conversation with her about the baby shower when he had to use my phone to check google maps. He said she was trying to make it about HER and not about me, which makes sense. And he pointed out that she had moved almost half the country away, why was she so determined to butt into my life all the time, what about her own? She hadn't made the effort to actually come visit since I told her I was pregnant and yes I told her to wait, but I think if she really wanted to come she would have anyway.

So I decided to just stop responding to her. She would text once a day to ""check in"" as usual, but when I didn't respond after a few days, she left a voice message saying she would get in touch with our other friend to make sure I was still alive. Really dramatic. Turns out she DID call other friend, who lucky didn't know about Mark but did know I was alive and well, so Jane could stop worrying. And then she text or call once a week, then every other week...all along the same lines that she was worried, what had happened, was this still my number? And so I just ignored them and had my baby boy a few weeks ago.

I posted pictures on Facebook, proudly stated that WE (Mark and I) are so happy to start a family together with our son and left it at that. Among all the congratulations phone calls and texts, Jane both emailed, texted, and left a phone message saying how happy she was that both me and the baby were okay, that she'd been so worried something had happened, did I still want her to come visit, and that she didn't know what had happened with us but she would always be there for me if I needed her.

Mark once again said if she'd been REALLY worried, she should have called the police or social services to do a wellness check on me, and while I thought that was a little extreme it was kind of a good point. What if something HAD happened to me? So I didn't respond, and every other day I post some new pictures and at first Jane always hearted and commented on them about the baby and hoping I was doing well, but then she started to just like heart or like and is no longer commenting, so maybe she's getting the message.

And I feel I don't need her around right now, since Mark and I are adapting to being new parents, and I really think she would yell at him and probably tell me I was being stupid for trusting him, so I don't need that drama. Lots of people have gotten over cheating before and I know I forgive Mark and love him and he will be a great father.

But I think back to the twenty years before all this and really, really need to know if I'm doing the right thing or not."
880,"Me (19m) and my partner (20f) have been with each other for about 4 months and we’re both aware of our sexual history. I got tested for stds when we got together, apparently HPV isn’t part of the general screening, and i came back clean. Since I came back clean we’ve had unprotected sex. Today I went to the doctor and they told me I have HPV. I’m seeing my partner later and will tell her. I feel so guilty and gross and its only made worse by the fact she might have it now because of me. Whats even worse is that she’s insecure about my sexual history before her. I feel like i’m in the calm before the storm and we’re about to blow up."
881,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (18F), have been together for 3 months. It feels like we’ve know each other our whole lives. My birthday is in October , the birthstone is Opal. I told him one time about how I used to ask my family for opal gifts, but it was always too expensive. On my birthday he gave me an gold ring with an authentic opal on it. It was so thoughtful, and I wasn’t expecting it at all.

His birthday is in December, and I have no clue what to get him. I want to get him something thoughtful like what he got me. I’ve gotten him a specialized Scott Pilgrim birthday card with his name printed on it, but that’s all I have so far! 

I’ll put a list of things that he enjoys:
-Scott Pilgrim
-Music (he plays guitar) 
-Music production
-Super Smash Bros
-Pokémon (card game or ds games)
-Cooking (he likes Japanese knifes)

If you have any ideas, please send them my way! It would be really helpful, thank you!!

EDIT — decided to put age, as the sub reddit asked posters to put. As well as commenters curiosity of my age."
882,"Hi. So this is my first ever post so sorry if it’s not that good. Plus I’m only 14.

So when I was really young I was pretty close with my family. We didn’t like tell each other everything, but I still spent a majority of my time with them and didn’t isolate myself from them.

Then my parents started having problems blah blah blah. During that time period I heard my mom say some pretty hurtful things about us kids( me, 14, sister, 16, brother, 10)  and my dad that I still can’t get over.  When this happened the family split apart and we haven’t been close since. Sometimes I feel like I live with strangers. Then she left to go to college to get her degree and be able to find a job.

I admire her for going back to school and finding a job to help the family out, but at the same time I resent her for it because the years she left were when I was 10-13 and a lot of things happened to me during that time. (Switching schools, bullying, me getting into lots of trouble) then she came back this summer permanently and acts like she hasn’t missed a thing and complains about having to take us places.

She was gone for 3 years so who do u think had to do EVERYTHING for us. My father. And he did a great job too. It must’ve been hell having to take 3 kids 20 different places in one day, take them to school, find someone to pick us up, and run a company but somehow he did. And I love him so much for it. Me and my dad don’t have the best relationship either for other reasons (one being boys and dating🙄)

Our relationship has been horrible ever since. But today seemed to be the last straw for me.

I was leaving school with my guys friends (one who has ADHD and ADD) and he was laughing. And she saw us.

Apparently she thinks his laugh is weird and as soon as I got in the car he asks “is he retarded?” I immediately defend him and tell her how much of a rude question that was and how that word is mean. She, of course, gets defensive and starts arguing with me saying “it was just a question. Calm down. I can leave you here and u can find ur way back home so watch it.”  Which I reply with “ok.” That goes on for a few minutes till we stop talking and the car is silent.

Now yes, I know it was just a question, but in my opinion, the word she used was mean. She didn’t have to say retarded. She could’ve just asked me if he had mental disorder or disability and I would’ve answered her. And that’s what I tried to explain to her in a calm voice but she didn’t listen. She also said since she’s my mother, she can’t be wrong, I can’t talk to her like that, I can’t correct her, and to stop being rude.

In my past I have been rude to my parents, but I’ve genuinely been trying to work on it. And it has gotten better. I haven’t been yelled at for some time. My grades have been great. And no trouble in school. Even my dad said I’ve improved so much.

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve mapped out my life and I plan on cutting contact with her or maybe my entire family once I’m out of high school because she genuinely makes me feel bad about myself and gets me in a bad mood whenever I’m around her and I don’t think good for myself in the future.

Now both my parents are from Nigeria and Nigerian parents give a few career options for their kids. (Doctor, lawyer, and engineer) but it’s gotten to the point where if what I want isn’t in the medical field, it’s a “no,” “nope” or one time a “well I’m not gonna help or support you so be prepared to live on the streets.”

I’m kinda ranting at this point but I honestly can’t deal with her anymore. This isn’t the first problem we’ve had either. 

Now I’m not saying I’m super close to my dad either, cuz I’m definitely not, but with him he seems like he at least has a little bit of genuine care for me. I don’t get that from my mom at all.

Idk, my whole family is a wreck at this point.

I also can’t just go to them and tell them what I’ve been feeling for years at this point. I know them and I know I’ll just get yelled at.

I guess I just needed to rant. If anyone has any advice for me plz comment. 

And if anyone thinks I’m being a brat plz leave me advice to get my act together. I see close families on the internet and with my friends and I envy that. I want that for my family so I’ll do the work on myself to get it.

Sorry if this was messy. Thank you for reading and commenting if u did. Have a nice day."
883,"Long story short, me, brother and mum have had a hard life growing up in poverty, abuse etc. I now have a 4 year old sister, 16 year age gap. I’m tired of how toxic and manipulative my mum is. I’m so tired of being here everyday, acting as if I’m okay because she forces me to be. If I’m not feeling too good mentally, she’ll start yelling and saying I’m a shit person and how she’s the one who’s depressed and she holds bills on her head etc and I’m ungrateful. I’ve helped her my whole life battling her depression. But I’ve been going through mental health difficulties since I was 12. It’s always been too much to handle, I’ve been going counselling since I was 14. I’ve had medication, I just feel like leaving here, but I get guilt tripped into how she’s raised me as a single mum etc and how hard it’s been on her. Our relationship is so bad that I can’t even tell her about my doctors appointments for health issues I’m having. She’s not someone I’m comfortable with talking to, I cant rekindle our relationship again, no matter how hard I’ve tried. It’s too much"
884,"A little backstory: dated a woman long distance for almost two years, multiple trips back and forth to visit each other. Two months ago we moved in together. It's been difficult financially as she hasn't gotten a job yet (rubs me the wrong way since there are jobs everywhere in our city and many decent paying ones). There's also been some tension as she is a bit of a slob and has bad habits but I figured these things would improve over time so that's not the biggest issue really. Anyways, my phone was dead and I needed to Google something last night and used her tablet. She was looking at dozens of apartments listings online. What's your folks take on this? Do I approach her about it?"
885,I’m a 20 guys who’s always around this girl and she always seems alittle nervous around me. How do I tell if she’s just shy and might like me or if she’s creeped out?
886,"Would you double date with a friend you’re secretly in love with, but refuse to tell him? This guy I’ve been friends with for a few years he wants me to double date with him whenever I come visit. He claims I would have a lot of fun with him in person and actually being around him(I always tell him I feel like he’s uptight). What would you do? I don’t know if I could look at them together on the date and be happy with it. I’m soo confused I don’t even know why I would love him in the first place. Help please! 
I forgot one thing he claims we are not even the least bit compatible and it has something to do with my emotional stability."
887,"When we were first talking to each other, she was talking with me and another guy. Which was fine because I was also talking with other girls at the time. Then after that we actually started to date and I stopped any sort of contact with any girls I had interest in. I made it VERY clear I didn’t like how she would still talk with him after we started to date, so she told me that she would block him on everything, I never asked her to block him just not keep in contact. A few months go by and she sends me some meme on Facebook, which I haven’t logged onto for 3 years and she knew I had no interest in actually making a Facebook. So after I look at the meme I’m curious about her Facebook and look at it. I notice it says she is single and I look down at her friends and see him in her top friends (not sure if it’s actually sorted in any order he was just in the top). So I click on his profile and look at the pictures he has posted and notice my wife has “❤️” every single one, being as recent as 2 weeks ago.

I’m just upset that she assured me that she had him blocked on everything when I didn’t even ask her to do that. I just feel lied to and that she is trying to hide something

Should I be worried? Am I wrong for my feelings being hurt?"
888,"4 months ago I disappeared from the life of my best friend(f30) because I discovered I was in love with her and that she didn't like me in that way. Now I am utterly broken, I isolated myself and now probably I'll leave the country for a new job opportunity

She never wrote to me after that. After isolation I attempted suicide cutting myself. I suffer from abandonment issues and I think that I will never be loved by anyone

I am so scared and broken inside. I feel extreme cold through my bones"
889,"I always thought I was an easy going person. Turns out I'm a c#nt. Sorry if this reads like shit, I have had a few wines and have spent the best part of 2 hours crying.

I have been struggling a lot recently. Came off the pill a few years back to try for kids, went on antidepressants as I had felt shit for 15 years, came off antidepressants as thought they were hindering conception, found out months later that is was in fact infertility. 

Fast forward to trying to get used to a life with no children, ever. The world is out oyster. Everything you see on people's bucket lists is within easy reach (unless the 2 doggos say otherwise!)

Thing is, I am now a changed person. When I came off the pill I put weight on. I also found it increasingly difficult to get out of bed. I used to be a maybe one time snoozer, now it's easily 5 snoozes before I can get up (and more often than not it's because the dogs need their breakfast)

I love my husband. We used to have this thing that I would tell him I like him, and in a way it would mean more because anyone can love a family member, but to actually like them means something different. I am bringing this up because I told myself the other day that even though I love him, I do not like him right now... But that is because I don't like myself. 

When he tells me about his day at work I start switching off. It's a habit that started after he kept going into detail about certain things within his role. Now I am by no means that intelligent. I bearly scaped by with my 5 faces, shoddy 6th form and then a btec in art. My common sense is there, but I know my capacity cannot reach that of the people I have around me. So when he starts going into detail I cannot for shit picture what the hell he is on about. Brain goes into tapping monkey mode. Thing is now as soon as he starts speaking about anything work related, that fucking monkey is there and I cannot shut him up to even try to listen and respond.

He's angry, I'm angry. I flat out stonewall him quite a lot recently because I cannot even comprehend some of the things he is saying. And because I am such a tool, and maybe I should be learning this to keep him happy. But then why should I? Well maybe it's because I signed up for this. 

My mind has been racing for a while. Even to the point of sleeping with other people. But then why should I put my shit onto someone else. Then I realise that my husband is dealing with me right now. 

It's so hard because I am my true self around him. Nothing hidden. Flaws and all. Yet I myself hate the person that I am when I don't gives things a second thought. 

What I earth do I say to my partner, my lover, my soulmate of 12 years that I cannot get on with the person looking back in the mirror, but you have to?!"
890,"Slowly tearing my relationship apart but I don’t know how to stop

My fiancee and I have been together for a couple of years now. I proposed a little over a month ago.

I’m starting to discover traits and feats in/of myself I can finally name by their appropriate tags. I’m neurotic, I’ve got anger management issues, I’ve got an insanely stressful job which isn’t helping any of the above and I’ve never been able to talk about my feelings. 
I’m also a horribly introverted einzelganger, but I’ve never felt more comfortable with anyone else than with her. I don’t need alone time from her. Being with her, even if it’s just on the couch together, or playing videogames for hours on an end barely talking .. it’s soothing and it calms me down. 

Lately, my job’s been getting more and more stressful. People are leaving, which is leaving me with more and more responsibility. I’ve graduated a little over a year ago, but I’m treated the same (responsibilities and workload) as my colleagues with over ten years of experience. Our department has been putting in 50-60 hour workweeks to keep up with the increasing workload, which doensn’t appear to be lightening anytime soon.

We’ve bought a house a little under a year ago. It was a “fix me up”-er, because it was all we could afford to move to the place we needed to move to for both our jobs. The housing market is exploding here, where we had to choose between a house with a lot of maintenance, or renting an apartment for an insane price. Anyway, the renovation is coming along fine, we were already done with the kitchen and the livingroom is just 8 months. However, because of the state of the house (being in the middle of a renovation and some rooms having literal piles of garbage/rubble), we couldn’t possibly sell the house as is without making losses on it.

This is all part of the backstory, as I’m getting to the conversation we had today.
We’ve been kind of drifting apart the last couple of weeks. After I proposed, we were both happy about getting married. This lasted until our vacation ended (we traveled a week abroad where I proposed). We’re having lots of arguments, we’re barely intimate anymore..

When I came home today, I realized I couldn’t even remember the last time she paid me a compliment. I always try to comment her on the small things, how I like the dinner she made, how she looks nice in a new skirt or blousse she bought .. I can’t ever express how happy she makes me and how beautiful I find her, but I try to compliment her whenever it pops in my head. Regardless of that, I couldn’t recall receiving any compliments as of late. She used to tell me the same kind of things, how she liked the way my hair looks today, or that I smell nice.
It lead to me asking why she hadn’t paid me any recently. I said that I was confused about the way we treated eachother for the past months, and that I felt like she’s still with me because we couldn’t possibly get rid of the house, not because she looks forward to seeing me again at the end of her day.

She didn’t really disagree with it, and it broke me. We talked, and she kept saying how she gets that I have a very stressful job and how she’s grateful I’m providing (she also works, I just have some “luxury” money left we get to spend on nice things after the basic necessities we cover together), but the anger issues I’ve had all my life had become unbearable. She still looks forward to seeing me every night, but whenever I get home I’m stressed and angry and anything little that doesn’t go my way puts me over the edge where I’m literally yelling. Whenever I get this angry, I feel this ball of anger inside that I just want to get out, both vocally and physically. 

It’s becoming more and more regular to get there, and I’ve started slamming my desk or punching walls to try and release the anger I feel inside. It’s scaring her. I would never even think of hitting her, but I know she genuinely fears the day that I will. Before I started this job (or any full-time job for that matter), I’d have these outbursts maybe once every couple of months. As of lately, it’s been weekly, if not bi-daily. 

I don’t know what I can do to stop it. I think I need to see a psychologist, but they’re way too expensive for me to afford. A single appointment leaves me without any “spending money” for the rest of the month. Is it bad enough for me to dip into my savings to get therapy? Do I need to quit my job?

I guess it’s just turned into one big ramble and I don’t know if it’s even coherent enough to be readable. I just felt like writing it all off ...

Tl;Dr - I’m destroying the one good romantic relationship I’ve had in my life and I don’t know why or how I can stop it. She’s the love of my life and I don’t know how long she’ll be able to stand being around me if I don’t change my behavior."
891,"TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of thoughts of suicide. 

Throw away account, I'm on mobile, and there's going to be some spelling and grammar mistakes, I'm sorry.

I don't even know what to title this. I'm so distraught. 

My boyfriend of 2 years and I broke up about a month and a half ago because he said he had shit he needed to work on that he needed to do alone. We lived an hour from each other and he wasn't open to the idea of moving in with me, due to a fear of big cities.

Despite the break up, we both loved each other. I was so desperate for him to come live with me and to help him. For maybe a week after we broke up I couldn't drop it. Part of this was because there were some questions he just couldn't answer. I needed answers to feel closure. 

We didn't talk to a while. I needed to figure out how to get over it without getting the closure he couldn't provide. 

After maybe 2-3 weeks of silence, we started talking again. He mentioned that he had suicidal thoughts during the silence because he felt so horrible about what he did to me. (I was in a complete depression. I didn't get out of bed, I couldn't sleep and came to work exhausted, constantly crying) I IMMEDIATELY told him that if he was to ever feel like that again, silence or not, he needs to call me. He was and is my best friend, I refuse to let him stay suicidal over something as small as our relationship. It's not worth it. 

When I took a trip to another country, we were friends again at this point. He calls me about a week ago in the middle of the night (my time, there's a 6 hour time difference) and tells me he loves me. 

The next morning I ask him wtf happened and he tells me he regrets the breakup. He wants to move in with me. He wants to start seeing a therapist. He wants to do what he needs to do and step up. 

I was... Surprised to say the least. I told him I'd think about it and that I wouldn't make a decision until my next therapy session at the very least. He was so understanding. 

Now to the actual problem:

We had a conversation where I basically asked a lot of questions about his intentions, what changed, why, etc. During this conversation, he found out I was seeing somebody. It's not serious. We've only been on like 4 dates, but since my ex is still in love with me, he's worried. It's a valid response. 

He asked me if I still loved him and after a really long silence I told him that I didn't know.

He absolutely panicked. He started crying and repeating things like ""I'm sorry"" and ""how did I get you to love me"" and finally he said ""i want to die""

In complete shock, I started to calm him down. He's never been like that. Ever. And I would have never expected if from him. 

I don't know how to tell him that we can't get back together. He doesn't know who he is without me and he's only doing these things because he wants to be with me. Not because he wants to find out who he is. I've been a constant in his life since he was a sophomore in high school, almost 4 years. He's scared. He wants to go back to how it was, and he wants to keep that constant. 

I can't let him do that, he needs to find himself without his life revolving around accommodating me or living my life with me, if that makes sense. I don't know how to break it to him without sending him into a suicidal panic. I'm going to do it in person. I'm going to make sure I set aside the whole day or weekend if I need to for him, but I don't live near him and I'll have to leave to go back to work the Monday after I plan to go see him. 

What do I do? How can I go about this? 

I care about him. He's still my best friend. I want to make this as easy as possible for him. I'm terrified."
892,"My gf had sex with another guy last weekend and she told me what happened. Me and her were on rocky terms so we were contemplating a break up. Long story short she gets on tinder to find friends being naive thinking that she could make friends with guys on the app. So she goes to this guys house with no intent to have sex with him. She does some shots of vodka with him (they are the only ones in the house) and one thing led to another and she ended up having sex with him. She came back to me and told me a few days afterwards and she was crying like crazy and apologetic saying she don’t know why she did that and how gross she feels. I love her to the moon and back 1000x but is this unforgivable? We have been together for 4 years and we were virgins when we met and lost our virginity’s to each other so it was a really special thing to me and I think I want to continue onwards but I don’t know how to feel knowing another man got pleasure from her and got to experience something so personal with her. I feel wronged but I want to stay with her should I?
(this is the only time this has happened)"
893,"Long post ahead. I (30YOF) have been dating my girlfriend (29YOF) for about 2 years. It’s been a rocky road. When we first met, she was not ready to dive into a new relationship; she was in daily communication with her ex girlfriend. I instantly liked her and wanted to date her. In my desperation, I did a lot of things that I had never done before in a new relationship- talk openly (but not always the truth) about my ex’s, tried to be super adventurous in bed (we had a three some, which I instantly regretted and actually caused some problems), kept a few people on the back burner just in case things didn’t work out between us. I was insecure and jealous because she was always talking to her ex. Even while she laid in my bed, I’d catch her FaceTiming her. 

Needless to say, this bit me in the ass. She found out I was talking to other people while we were well into dating. She felt betrayed and lied to. And rightly so. Those things still haunt our relationship to this day. She doesn’t trust me. 

We love each other very much. But our fights are colossal. We yell. I say very mean things about her. She’s broken some expensive items of mine and I’ve also done the same. And as of recently, these fights have begun to get physical. 

I vowed to work on my anger issues and I’ve been working with a therapist. I’ve suggested couples counseling, but she’s not too keen on the idea. 

Last night, she told me she felt like after 2 years, she doesn’t know who I am. She was gone. I could see it in her eyes and feel it in my heart. I told her this. And her reply was, “I’d like to believe that you aren’t relieved by this, but I know that’s not true. You are relieved. I’ll never forgive myself for thinking we loved each other the same way.” 

She broke up with me. Not in those exact words, but it was clear. This morning, she woke up, asked if we were broken up, and then proceeded to have me lay in bed with her while she said she loved me and wanted to make this work. 

She also asked to have my car for the day. When I said no, she started yelling at me, so I gave in and let her take it because I didn’t want to fight. 

I don’t know what to do. Those words she said to me last night cut deep. I spent the entire night sleepless trying to figure out what to do next. 

So what do y’all think? I love her with every fiber in my body. She’s kind, she’s compassionate and I wanted to make her my wife. But now I’m so conflicted. I feel like she doesn’t like me. And sometimes, I feel like I don’t like her."
894,"On mobile and a little long so hang tight

I (23F) have no relationship with my mother or brother (father passed when I was 10).

My mother verbally and psychologically abused me until she kicked me out 5 years ago when I was on summer break from college. My brother and I were close when we were kids but after my father’s death he became abusive towards me while staying my mother’s golden child. I never really had a relationship with my mother because she always pushed me away and generally couldn’t stand me (still don’t know why).

I have info about my mother and brother through my maternal uncle. 2 years ago, my brother moved in with his girlfriend and she got pregnant a little over a year later. My mom sent me a text to let me know (she texts me for things like these but that’s it). Three months into the pregnancy, the girlfriend dumped my brother.

A couple weeks ago I saw my aunt (uncle’s wife) and we got to talking about my brother’s situation. She told me that when they were still together she asked the GF if she knew my brother has a sister, the Gf replied that when she tried to talk about it with my brother he responded with “I don’t have a sister”.
The GF doesn’t want anything to do with him and he doesn’t seem too bothered by it, my mother though decided to fight for her “grandmother’s rights”. I don’t know how this is going but today she sent me a picture of the baby with a text saying “hi auntie”.

The thing is, i want to know my niece and, if the mother agrees, have a relationship with her, but it’s complicated for me to do so by going through my mom because I don’t want her to use it as leverage against me. My aunt doesn’t have direct contact with the GF either. As for my brother, he is the kind of person who only comes to you when he needs something (like calling me when I was a 19 year old student who got kicked out by my mom to ask me to lend him 800€, which I didn’t have).

I really want to be an aunt but resuming contact with my mum might just mess me up like it did when I was a kid and my brother obviously doesn’t want anything to do with me (no one knows why). And honestly even if the GF let me be a part of the baby’s life, I’m scared my mothers decision to fight for a right that is only, imo, the mother’s decision, will make a mess of it and ruin my chances.

I still haven’t responded to my mother’s text because I don’t want to engage a conversation with her without knowing what I’ll do next.

Any advices ?"
895,"I (28/M) have been hanging out with this guy, let’s call him Randy (40/M), for about one year. We met on an app and chatted for about 6 weeks before I finally met him in person. Due to the distance between us (about an hour drive), we only saw each other a few times during the first two months. However, I could tell there was a connection between us. We continued hanging out when we could, and we eventually started seeing each other more often. During the spring and early summer, things were going really well, and I kind of assumed we were “seeing each other”, even though we never had that conversation. I really wanted to “define the relationship” and have that talk, but I was afraid I would scare him off. I was happy with the way things were, I knew that labeling our relationship wouldn’t really change much (in terms of how often we see each other and talk), and I was pretty confident he wasn’t trying to see other people (neither was I). Also, I was naively assuming he would initiate the talk because he’s older and more experienced. For all of these reasons, I put off having “the talk.”

A few months ago, I noticed little things begin to change. He became a little less affectionate, we wouldn’t hang out as much, and when we would go out for dinner or drinks, the conversation did not flow as easily as before. One night, after dropping me off at home, he texted me and asked if we had a status. I instantly became tense and anxious because I was expecting the worst, and because this seemingly came out of nowhere. I told him we haven’t talked about it, but I would love to have that conversation. He texted me back and said he thought we were in the friends category. I immediately asked if we could talk instead of text, so I called him. We ended up having an emotional conversation about a lot of stuff going on in his life at the moment – friends, family, his job – and we didn’t really talk about our status. During the next few weeks after that conversation, things were relatively normal. We still texted and hung out the same amount as before, and the topic didn’t come up. I wanted to bring it up and continue the conversation, but there wasn’t a good time (in my opinion). So I put it off.

To back track a little, a few months after we started hanging out, Randy went to Europe for vacation. He ended up meeting a guy there on one of the first days (let’s call him Anthony), and apparently they instantly hit it off. Anthony hung out with Randy and his friends on a few of his excursions, and when it was time to leave, they decided to keep in touch. During the time when things were going really well with me and Randy, I would occasionally see texts pop up from Anthony, but I figured he was an old friend or something. I never knew how they met.

Fast forward to my emotional conversation with Randy… one of the things he mentioned was that his friend Anthony was coming to visit soon, and that he really liked him. When I heard that, I had a mini panic attack. Why did he just tell me he liked someone? I thought he liked me? We didn’t spend much time on that topic, but I remembered he said it, and that stuck with me for the next few weeks.

Fast forward to last month – Anthony comes to visit. Leading up to his visit, as I mentioned before, things were relatively normal between me and Randy. I wanted to have “the talk”, but I didn’t see a good opportunity to have it. When Anthony arrived, I gave Randy his space to enjoy the visit. I didn’t text him at all during the week-long visit, and he never texted me. However, Randy posted most of the visit on social media, so I got to see exactly what they were doing.

Every new post and picture that I saw of the two of them broke my heart a little bit more. During the year-or-so that Randy and I were “together”, he never posted about us on social media, and he didn’t have many pictures of us together saved on his phone. Now Anthony comes to visit and he posts selfies and pictures of every place they go. I was extremely jealous and pretty miserable the whole week.

When Anthony finally left, Randy texted me and we began to communicate as normal. I knew that I needed to talk to him about how I felt, so I went over to his house one night to watch a movie. Before the movie, we decided to order food, so he opened an app on his phone, put in his order, and then handed me the phone to place my order. He left the room to use the bathroom, and I had a very strong urge to snoop through his pictures to see what I could find, so I did. The reason I did so was because I guess I wanted to confirm what I already thought, but didn’t want to admit – that Randy sees us as friends and nothing more. Well, I guess I got what I asked for. There were pictures/videos of them doing things they didn’t post about, selfies of them kissing, and even some x-rated videos. My heart literally sank into my stomach and I started to have a panic attack. Randy came back and saw that I wasn’t myself, and that’s when I finally told him we need to talk.

I asked him what he thought about us and the past year. He said that there were times when he wanted to take our relationship to the next level, and he was looking for signs from me that indicated I wanted to do the same. I absolutely wanted to take things to the next level, but as I said above, I was afraid I would scare him off and I didn’t want to mess up what we had going. Therefore, he interpreted my actions as not wanting to take the next step and just stay where we were. So I guess he assumed I wanted to stay more as friends, which is not at all what I wanted. However, since neither of us said anything to one another over the next few months, we both kept assuming what the relationship was. I assumed we were “exclusive” but not exactly boyfriends, and he assumed we were nothing more than friends or FWB. Now there is someone else in the picture that Randy clearly has feelings for. I tried to ask Randy about him and Anthony and what he considered them to be, and he said that he is unsure. He’s unsure whether to pursue a relationship, or just let it go because of the distance.

I left the conversation in an OK headspace, but when I got home, I completely broke down. I’ve been an anxious, miserable wreck for the past week thinking about how I missed my chance with Randy. How we both had feelings for each other and all it took was for one of us to say something. Or would that have even mattered because he had been texting Anthony the whole time we were “together”? I feel extremely guilty for snooping through Randy’s phone, and I can’t get the pictures/videos out of my head. Does Randy still have feelings for me? He did at one point, and we’ve remained friends this whole time. Is he going to move to Europe to try and make it work with Anthony? Or are they not going to try and make it work?

I asked Randy if we can continue our conversation this weekend and he agreed. **I guess I’m looking for advice about the situation in general and potential questions I can ask Randy**. So far this is what I have:

· I still really like you and have feelings for you. Do you still have feelings for me? Or is the door shut on us and you’re trying to make the relationship with Anthony work?

· I feel very guilty about snooping through his phone and I’m wondering if I should confess?

· Should I ask about Anthony? Or will the details of their relationship just make me feel worse?

**TL;DR**: I’ve been hanging out with a guy for one year. We never defined the relationship. I thought we were more than friends, he thought we were just friends. Now he has feelings for someone else, but I still have feelings for him. What should I do?"
896,"I’ve known this wonderful girl(24 yrs old; Capricorn - I’m 32 Male;Cancer) for about 2 years. We met through work and hit it off immediately. She was in a relationship and called off her engagement about three months after we met but it was due to him watching porn according to her which is her biggest dealbreaker and she considers it cheating. He admitted to doing it about a year into their relationship and then supposedly stopped, but she said it was unforgivable. It’s been over a year since the engagement has been called off, but she still lives with her boyfriend along with her daughter from a previous relationship. Since the first day she and I met we would talk for hours at a time, it was like we’ve known each other for years so I’m not sure if our connection had anything to do with the engagement been called off?!

I was recently working on self-improvement and started nofap to pretty much get over her, but I started doing some doing research one night on why she’s having a hard time leaving and came across fear of abandonment. All the symptoms I’ve read about it lineup with her. I’ve said some harsh things to her in the past and I’ve apologized profusely for them. She says she forgives me, but somehow they always find their way back into our conversations. She started dressing the way I like, doing her make up the way I like, doing her hair and things of that nature the way I like.

A few months ago I told her that if she renewed her car lease and he was on it that I would sever all ties and move on so she gave him back the car and got one in her own name. She also got an apartment three months ago but has yet to move out. It seems like every time we get close, she psychs herself out and starts to overthink everything and we go back to ground zero but I’ve been persistent because I know she has FOA and I continue to be there for her and reassure her. She’ll tell me things like “I don’t see a relationship with you past sexual” and “you could have any girl you want, why me?” And recently she started saying “I don’t ever see myself moving out“, but she will not cancel her apartment lease and all of her stuff is in there.

 I told her that if she moved out I would be her boyfriend as I felt like she was fishing for that and wanted a tittle before moving out. Ever since I told her that she has been rejecting me hard, but she comes around very often, still wants to talk to me and if I don’t talk to her she’ll wonder around my desk waiting for me to start conversation. I told her that I loved her and that I love her daughter as if she was mine and would treat her that way. I know she has deep feelings for me but she’s absolutely terrified of admitting them and also feels guilty.

She’s staying at work a lot later than she supposed to be and on the weekends she doesn’t have her daughter she does things with her best friend rather than her boyfriend. This past weekend I went to a nightclub which she knew I was going to be at and she happened to be there which was shocking because she hates clubs and went out without her best friend which never happens and she also lives about 30 minutes away from it.

As far as her bf, she never brings him out, post pictures on social media of him even though they just celebrated their four year anniversary and his birthday about a month or so ago.

I’m at a crossroads and need any kind of help I can possibly get. What should I do? I keep trying to comfort her but sometimes she takes it the wrong way and tries to convince herself that I’m going to lie, cheat, hurt and betray her which I’m not. I told her that I found out what fear of abandonment was and I want to show her that true love and happiness does exist, but she keeps telling me that it doesn’t and she’s accepted the fact that she’ll never be happy nor in love.

 Like I said, ever since I told her that I would be her boyfriend if she moved out her FOA has gone to extreme measures and she’ll convince herself of something that I’m trying to do like manipulating her and shut down. It’s truly sad to see and even if I don’t end up being with her, I at least want to help her overcome fear of abandonment. If anybody has any advice on what to do, I’d gladly appreciate it. Thx

TL;DR"
897,"I (21F) am dating someone from another country. We have been together about 3 years, 2 years in the same country, and now one apart. When i left my boyfriend's country last, it was because i was going nursing school in my home country (international student fees are too expensive). 
Because i am getting certified in my country, and cost of living is much lower here, we decided that we wanted to both move here. Before i left, i single-handedly put together all of the required documents for a working visa for him to come back to my country. He was going to wait for a few paychecks to come in, and send it all off. 
Several months went by and he still hadn't done anything with it because he didn't have the money. He did, however have the money to buy a nearly $1000 gaming computer, and fast food for almost every meal, though. 
A few months later i found out he was on a dating site looking for hookups. I was furious. He cried and apologized for hours and promised me he would make it up to me by sending the visa off that month. He did not. 
Several months later we had an argument about it. We nearly broke up and again he made a promise that he would send the visa asap. At this point, all of the required documents had changed and he had to re-do all of the paperwork, police checks, medical checks etc. 
Several months later, he is saying that he is coming to visit for a few weeks around christmas. However, his mother has now decided she wants to help with the booking process (even though he is in his 20's) and she wants to use her (very expensive) travel agent. He told me this 2 weeks ago. I have booked through this agent before and know she is very quick at her work (took her 2 days to book a complicated vacation for me). My boyfriend claims that his mom has just not heard from her yet and he refuses to book the ticket without using his mom's agent. I have already booked time off work at  christmas because i needed to give them an answer and he was adamant that he would book it within a week (this was several weeks ago). He constantly says that he is going to work on it ""after work"" or ""tomorrow"", or ""on the weekend"", but doesn't ever do it. He does have time, though, to log 8+ hours of video games on his days off. 
Now every time i mention it, he brings up how cruel i am for triggering his anxiety by making him stressed about it. He makes me feel like an assh*le for being insensitive by even mentioning it. He is dealing with really bad mental health issues, and i'm worried that if we break up he'll do something bad. At the same time, i have waited almost a year and he has done nothing but make excuses. 

Any advice? 

Tl/dr my boyfriend is supposed to be getting a visa so that we can live together. He's been ""working on it"" for a year and hasn't done it."
898,"My girlfriend has BPD, and is very sensitive/fearful of abandonment. I brought up a suggestion one time a few months ago that maybe we could spend one day per week apart (we usually spend every day together) and it did not go well.

I am being burnt out by school and by her and by having no real breaks. I am exhausted.

I want to be with her but for my own well being I think I need some alone time to read, play chess, play music, etc. I'm really scared that she will break up with me if I ask her for alone time.

Advice?"
899,"Alright, here we go. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I met my boyfriend last year at college. We lived on the same floor and quickly became best friends. I was like oh cool I have a big fat friend crush on this boy... until I realized it was just a regular crush and I was screwed. 

It didn't take long until I noticed this girl he kept signing in. They'd go to his room and I never got introduced to her. I was immediately jealous of her but when I asked him he just said no nothing was happening. Eventually I found out they had dated in high school, but he said he didn't like her anymore and we weren’t an item so I tried to keep my jealousy at bay. 

Fast forward to this summer. We started dating in June and we were talking one night and I find out they'd been hooking up (no sex) throughout the school year. He thought I knew, but naive and trusting as I am, I had no idea. I felt like a fool. I brought up that he lied to me but I also realized that if I had known I would've abandoned all hope of ever being with him. And it would've destroyed me. Basically, if he had fessed up when I asked him, we wouldn't be dating now. So I made him swear never to lie to me again and moved on.

I guess it's worth noting that I told him I liked him several times throughout the year and, while he hinted he liked me too, was worried about ruining the friendship we had and has also said he was in a rough place and didn't feel like he deserved to be with me. Protecting me or some silly stuff like that. 

Fast forward to now. Seeing her is torture. It's a reminder of their past and makes me pretty upset and I know that's immature but I can't help it. The real kicker is, I think she still likes him and has possibly been subtweeting him on her finsta (that she knows he follows). They snapchat and text but he's been limiting responses and she's getting pissed. She apparently shuts down when he mentions me and I feel so much hate for her. I know this isn't fair because I wasn't dating him at the time and it's in the past and if anyone should be jealous it's her because I'm the one dating him now. But I can't help it. 

It's just weird because she was his first and only other girlfriend and it feels like she was just such a big part of his life. Like they went to prom together and there are tons of pictures of them together in his family’s living room at home. I can't change anything that happened and I need to get over it. 

I don’t know how much, if any, jealousy is normal and consequently try to avoid it at all costs. Jealousy makes me super uncomfortable since that was how my ex manipulated me. 

I'm not breaking up with him so leave that advice out. How do I get over my boyfriend's ex?

TLDR:
Boyfriend’s high school ex goes to the same college as us and I’m jealous because of things that happened after we met but before we dated. How to proceed?"
900,"hey, not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but basically I asked someone out on a date to get coffee the conversation went a bit like this. 

me: hey I was wondering if you wanted to get coffee sometime. 

her: why? 

me: I dont know I would like to get to know you better. When we facetimed last week you seemed  really chill. plus worst case scenario you get free coffee. 

her: ok, where and when?


and that is how it went, no clue where I am at atm. no idea what I should think at the moment."
901,"Ok so this might sound like such a non-issue and like I am being ungrateful but honestly I am not. So...my boyfriend and I have been together for roughly a year and a half. He's quite well off and he likes to shower me with gifts, often expensive gifts. Sometimes I'd just look at something at a shop and contemplate and he'd just buy it for me later (without me asking or knowing about it). I grew up in an average income family and I have always followed the ""need vs want"" policy when spending. So for an example I've been wanting a fitbit for quite sometime before I met bf and sometimes I look at it at the store and play around with it but I know I don't need it so never bought one. Bf bought one for me. This is just one example. He's gifted me clothes, skincare etc that are way beyond my normal price point. 

Now the thing is, he willingly does this for me. He says its not a problem for him cause he is living within his means. And that sometimes you just have to buy things that make you happy and not necessarily things that you need. I understand this too. But I also think there is a difference between treating yourself and allowing someone to treat you. But then again I know my bf buys me things because he loves me and its his way of showing affection and so rejecting his gift is like rejecting his love (which is not great for our relationship). But because I cannot reciprocate cause I don't earn enough ( I can save up and get him a nice thing for like every five things he gets me) and also because I have never been one to give gifts. 

My bf has told me that he is fine with the way things are. That he is happy with how we are. That he loves me and likes buying me things. I just feel inadequate because I cannot give him things like he does for me. I am also uncomfortable with accepting his gifts (but I do because as I said rejecting gifts seem like a very rude thing to do) because I feel like I am doing something wrong buy having these expensive things. Also a bit like I am a golddigger (although I am absolutely not with him for money). I also want to reciprocate his kindness and give him things but I simply cannot afford to give him gifts like he does for me. I try to cook for him and just be very affectionate (well I am just an affectionate person I don't know whether this counts). 

Anyway....any advice is appreciated. How do I feel secure about accepting his gifts and how can I reciprocate in an as worthy way?

tldr: pretty much the title"
902,"My SO and I are long distance. I frequently text him ""I miss you,"" but he never texts back ""I miss you too."" I get upset that he doesn't text me back, which makes me want to tell him that I'd appreciate it if he told me how he felt as well. But I feel like if I do that, then he'll start saying ""I miss you too"" back to me, which is what I want, but I feel like it wouldn't be genuine. Idk, I feel like I've put myself in a lose-lose situation here, and I'm unfairly expecting him to meet my expectations without letting him know what I need. Any advice?"
903,"2 days ago i broke up with my girlfriend after having a relationship for over a year. This was actually my first ever serious relationship. We loved each other so much and had many amazing memories together.  Her and I had many plans for Halloween and Christmas and big hopes for a future in life together. One year together may not seem like a lot to some people, but it felt like a life time to me. Although we had our good times we also had nasty fights where we would hurt each other. My girlfriend had lots of mental health issues. Her father commit suicide at a young age and she was sexually assaulted. For these reasons she was a very sensitive individual where I am not. I protected her and dealt with her mental break downs for months because i tried to be understanding with her situation. Eventually it became a toll on me and i became less and less patient and we would argue more. I still loved her and wanted it to work out but our personalities just didn’t match up. I became a big asshole in the last couple of months we dated and her mental health got even worse. I made the decision to break up to save us both. It was so hard for me to do that because i really did love this girl but her sensitivity was causing many stresses in my life. i had to censor myself for her to not make her cry. it’s been two days since our break up and i have never felt so lost and lonely in my life. I didn’t even get to see her one last time to tell her i was sorry for all the times i hurt her.  she has already started talking to new guys and that really hurts me that she would move on that quickly. it seems like she doesn’t care and now i’m the one stuck here hurting. i have had no motivation to really do anything the last two days and all i can picture in my mind is her with other guys now. on top of everything, i’m getting instagram messages from random burner accounts telling me that they stole my girl from me and they own her now.  I know they say time will heal but i’m hurting so bad right now. for some reason i cant let this relationship go even when we weren’t meant for each other."
904,My girlfriend (19) and I have been dating for almost three years we never had this problem intill now I known this guys from  school and she has to but she talks to him everyday morning to night but when she’s with me she doesn’t text ive seen there messges and it looks innocent but still it bothers me she reassured me that she only wants to be with me and she just likes the conversations they have but I’m going crazy I need advice :(
905,"So, I started seeing a guy I met off Tinder a few months ago. We get along great, have a ton of stuff in common, the sex is amazing - but we’re both moving to different parts of the country around June/July. We’ve had a very clear discussion about the fact that we really like each other, and that it’s nice that we are on the same page about not seeking out a committed relationship for the same reasons. 

I am trying really, really hard to stay in the moment and enjoy what we have while we have it, but the longer we see each other, the harder that’s getting. We have pretty opposite schedules so we only really see each other once a week or so, sometimes going even longer between dates. He’s not the best at keeping up text communication, but is always enthusiastic and engaged if I text him first. I get the feeling he’s doing a little better with keep an emotional distance than I am, though I have caught a few moments where he seems to get more intimate than I expected. 

I really, really want to be able to keep this up, because spending time with him is really genuinely lovely. Any advice on how to maintain perspective on this? Is another 7 months of this unrealistic?"

My question is, how to keep the spark alive as the years go by and lives are busy? We both have demanding work lives and oftentimes are pretty tired in the evenings or weekend.

908,"TLDR: fiancé has saved pictures of friend/coworker to masturbate to. 

My (30f) Fiancé (31m) has a close relationship with his coworker (25f) (they give each other relationship advice, he’s told her re: new guy she was dating “you’re a bombshell, he’s hot, go have some fun”, that she’s too good for her boyfriend and they should break up (after he cheated on her) etc..). I’ve tried to be okay with their friendship as I realize my issues stem from my own insecurities as she is a very attractive woman. They go on work trips together (with the whole small office) and he takes pictures of her in bikinis etc for her social media posts, and has asked her on this one trip to go out for a drink (just the two of them because she was upset about something). Anyway, I found out he has been saving pictures of her to masturbate to. He says he’s not interested in her in any way, just that she’s “hot” and he “wanted to see her naked”. He also requested someone photoshop her nude. 
I feel betrayed, especially since I’ve asked if I had anything to worry about there, and he’s said no. Am I overreacting? I don’t know what to do. Advice?

*edit: he’s denied ACTUALLY masturbating to any pictures. Says he saved them to request the nude photoshopping (also requested of another girl he knows), but said that request was never fulfilled so he’s deleted original pics and forgotten about it. Not sure what to believe. He’s been very apologetic (to the point of tears), offered to quit his job, and seems to know what he did is wrong. I don’t think he’d ever cheat - But am I a sucker for staying and trying to make this work?? HELP!"
909,"I’ve been in a relationship for two months and my partner is a complete introvert, especially in comparison to myself. I wear my heart on my sleeve and am very open and emotional. He on the other hand is very quiet about this kind of stuff, which I perceive as rude and uncaring. Several arguments have come about recently as a result of our clashing personalities, specifically with regards to discussing feelings and the relationship. I’m the kind of person who needs constant reassurance. I often feel he is cold by comparison. We had our first big fight and he wants to spend a week apart before we see each other again. When we have conflict he wants to be apart, I want to be even closer. How do I deal with accepting he deals with things in a different way I do, without taking it so personally all the time?"

Update:: We talked and it turns out she really wanted to keep it after thinking about it. We decided to do this and start getting ready for what comes next. Thank you for all the feedback and support reddit!! Really helped more than you know today.

911,"The girl I originally liked got a boyfriend. She's the cheerleader who really likes baseball. Then I text this girl in my Spanish class cuz she's one of the only people I somewhat know in that class. I just asked her if there was a test today, then she said yeah, then we've been texting for 2 days now. So then we were texting after school today and I find out she doesn't really like baseball a lot, which is one of my most important things.... she’s such a sweet and caring person and she’s got a great personality and she’s pretty, but baseball is one of the most important things in my life. I don’t know what to do. She seems like she’s interested in me, and I’m not sure on that. I’m torn between still talking to her and eventually asking her out, or stop talking to her. But I feel it’s immature if I stop talking to her because of a sport that I really like and she doesn’t.  
What do I do here????"
912,"For context: Boyfriend and I have been together for 4 1/2 years. I’m from CA. We met in college on the east coast. We bought a house together about a year ago on the east coast close to his family.

Given the situation, I kind of expected that getting engaged would shortly follow. We talked about it and decided that that’s what we wanted to do. We were on vacation this past July, we looked at rings and to my surprise he bought one. He explained that he wanted to speak to my parents in person, which is understandable but difficult given that they live on the other side of the country. My parents visited and stayed with us in March (before ring) and most recently earlier this month (post ring). He said he would talk to them during this most recent visit, but he didn’t, claiming that there was no opportunity. I felt as if I gave him several chances (taking long showers, offering to go out to pick up food for dinner by myself, etc.). 

I’m getting very upset about the fact that he’s waiting for what seems to me like a long time. I’m starting to feel like he doesn’t want to get married anymore and if he did he would find a way to talk to my parents. I’ve tried to express this to him, but he’s adamant that he wants to talk to them in person. 

I’m starting to doubt our relationship but also feel stuck because I’m committed to a 30 year mortgage and very far from family.

Am I overreacting?"
913,"I'll do my best to make a long story short. So, here it goes.  A few months ago,  I was in desperate need for a second vehicle and was really pressed on time to get one. I asked my parents if I could borrow my dad's truck for just a couple weeks to let me figure something out. My wife was getting ready to start her next semester in college, and I was working 45 minutes away from home at the time. I needed another car to make life easier for the both of us. My dad agreed to let me borrow his truck. The only problem was that my brother has been using it for the past 2 years ever since he had wrecked his first car. My brother refused to give the truck up even for just a few weeks while I figure my stuff out. I had promised my dad and brother both that he would have it back in less than 30 days. My brother only needed the truck to get to college, once he's on campus he doesn't drive it and he only comes to visit my parents on break. Him being incredibly selfish made things horrendous on my wife, she had to drive 3+ hours a day to drop me off at work, go to school, pick me up, and finally go home. I knew this would be the case, and I promised my brother that because of this I wouldn't talk to him ever again. It really bothered me that he couldn't help us out, and I've not spoken to him since. Since then, I've gotten another job 5 minutes from home and having two cars isn't a big deal right now. I just don't know if I'm handling the situation right, and if not, what better ways there are."
914,"Sorry for this being long. Me and my girlfriend (25/M &amp; 24/F) are on the verge on ending an almost two year long distance relationship. The distance has seemingly never been an issue. She says that when I saw her last I was acting like an asshole, by doing things like making her feel like whenever she would get made I wouldn’t take her seriously. For example, she got upset that we couldn’t find a place to eat, because I thought that she was going to pick and she thought I knew where to eat, and she got upset at me when I got mildly upset when I said “man cmon, it’s just this!” Please note that I never have yelled at her including this time and simply said it out of frustration. When I saw she was upset, I promptly apologized and told her that I’m sorry I made her feel that way and that sometimes when I get a little frustrated, it’s not that big of a deal to me, but I now realize that she may not necessarily view it the same way and that I would look out for that in the future. 

When we were being intimate later on, I gagged while performing oral sex and asked her in a nonchalant tone, “hey can we go take a shower first, please” and she was devastated by me doing this, saying that she thinks she never wants to have sex with me again. Keep in mind that I have an incredibly sensitive gag reflex and actually have to take over the counter medication to help it, and she knew about it too. After seeing her so upset, I freaked out by having an emotional outburst (which is on me) because she was getting so upset. She knows I have anger issues and she has actually been helping me control them in the past, and since being with her, I’ve only had an outburst like this once before, months ago. I sincerely apologized and I’m only human and not perfect, but that I would do everything in my power to make sure my emotions are in check (by even enrolling myself in therapy). 

She slighted this and told me that I always say that I’m going to fix things or work on myself but that I only do it for two weeks and I go back to being my old self. She’s told me that she hasn’t been sexually satisfied with me in months and things that I’m doing get to her so much and that this was the final straw. For the past two months, I have felt that mostly every week she would be upset or I would do something wrong (unintentionally) or she would take out her anger on me, so I asked her in a calm voice why was that happening. She said it was because she was nervous about her future because she doesn’t know what she’s going to do after college, so she would be more volatile these next few months because of it, and I told her that I completely understand and that I’ll keep that in mind and to please let me know if she wants to talk about it. I’ve always told her that to please let me know if she ever wants to talk about anything and that I would never force her to tell me anything she didn’t want to tell me, and that I would always be open and nonjudgmental. 

This last week she tells me that the reason why she’s so unhappy with me now is because little things that I’ve been doing these past few months have been piling up. I’ve told her why she’s just been blaming it on her uncertain future and why she just wouldn’t flat out say it was because of things I would do. I’ve always said to please tell me things she doesn’t like that I do so I can fix them ASAP and that I wouldn’t get mad about it. She said that I should just “get” things and that she shouldn’t have to spell things out for me, even though at the beginning of the relationship I told her to please flat out tell me things to fix or whatever and she agreed. I told her I feel embarsssed that this whole time I’ve been just here enjoying life while she has been resenting me more and more each week and asked her why she didn’t tell me any of this before and she said that I was playing the victim. 

Since were doing long distance, we obviously can’t have sex all the time, and because of this we haven’t had sex since late July. The last few visits, we were unable to have sex because of various circumstances. She said her sex drive was going down and she initially blamed it on other things but eventually told me it’s because I don’t know how to please a woman. 

She told me I was immature and that I can’t fix nothing and that I’ve always been full of shit and I make things worse. I reminded her that I always listen to her and gave her examples of how I always listen to her and take responsibility for my actions to at which she said I was playing the victim again. She wouldn’t like when my parents would send me care packages in the mail because she would say I’m being pampered and babied by them, granted that her parents don’t do much for her anymore except pay her bills but that’s just how she was raised. I told her that I would start to become more independent and I honestly have. 

The weird thing is is that i haven’t even cried at all. I kinda feel numb. I’m heartbroken and sad and I’ve lost my appetite completely. Part of me wants to get back together because I miss her so much, we did share a lot of happy memories together, but part of me actually feels a sense of relief that it’s almost over because for more than half a year, I’ve felt like I’m walking on eggs shells around her, being ultra carefully about what I say so I wouldn’t offend her, and I’ve felt like I have to be on my best behavior around her. I haven’t been truly relaxed around her for a while now, and when I would bring that up to her, and would I would bring up when she would tell me things that hurt my feelings, she would say in a sarcastic voice, “sorry?” I knew that if I did that to her, she would get mad, so everytime she would get mad at me, I would tell her the same thing NOT out of spite, but to point out the hypocrisy to which she got mad of course. She would tell me things I would be doing wrong almost every week and at one point, I told her that I would sincerely listen to her, but I can’t change everything about me nor should I and that I would do my absolute best to give her what she wants to which she said she would back down a bit, but then about a month lasted she started it again. I’ve also felt that she’s put a strain on my relationship with my family as I feel more distant from them for various reasons.

She started shit while I was on vacation with my family. She says I take her for granted because I rely on her forgiveness too much and that there’s a line of girls and guys waiting for us to break up. It seems to me like she ignores the times that I have been mature and listened to her and have helped her and only chooses to look at the few times I’ve failed. For example, when I visited her one time, she called me annoying and she implied that she couldn’t wait for me to go back home so she could have some space, and that hurt me a lot but I choose to handle it like an adult and not freak out but yet she seems to not realize those moments that I do. Another example is that she recently told me she had doubts about us because she has never been with a woman and regrets not experiencing that to which I could’ve been so upset but again I handled it like an adult. I always take responsibly for my faults and it rarely seems like she does because she has told me that she hates to be wrong. She’s told me that I vent too much to her so I really limited what I would vent to her about. So just stuff like that. 

I feel terrible about this because I still genuinely love and care for her and I don’t want her to be hurting like she is now. We haven’t official broken up yet but I feel like she’s waiting for me to do it because she says she never knows when to exit a relationship. I feel confused and awful because this came out of nowhere. I’ve lost my appetite but at the same time feel a sense of relief. I have certainly done things in the past that have hurt us (unintentionally) to which I take full responsibility, but I can’t help it but think that she also contributed to where we are now, which according to her, is me turning it around on her and twisting her words. So please help me, I don’t even know how to feel right now. She blames it all on me, so please help me, how much is all this my fault. 

TL;DR!: gf and I are on verge of breakup because of things I’ve done that according to her I haven’t been changing about me."
915,"My bf [m28] and I [f27] have been together for 10 years. We have a four year old daughter together, we are not married, but have lived together that entire time and have our own house together and such. 
Throughout the entirety of our relationship he has been miserable, or at least like 70% of the time. But the guy has had a hard life... I won’t go into detail but it started from childhood. 
He is currently the stay at home dad with our daughter and I work, I have always been the working one even before we had our daughter, he’s just always struggled with holding a job because of his depression/anxiety/ptsd. Being SAHD just worked out because now he can stay home with purpose- raise our daughter, and I’ll continue working to pay the bills. Life goes on ~ 
The thing is, after being a stay at home dad for four years, the loneliness is REALLY eating away at him. The stay at home life is NOT easy, it’s especially rough for dads because there’s little support, it’s less common. 
He resents me for being able to go to work everyday, like it’s some sort of privilege. I hate my job, I would much rather be at home raising my daughter. We’ve talked about switching roles but there’s no way he can leap out into the job force after never having had a stable job and make the kind of money I make to pay our bills. My career is something I’ve worked on for the last 11 years. 
This causes a lot of fights. In general, I am not a touchy-feely person. Especially after being together for ten years, your sex life kind of loses its luster, on top of being drained and tired from working every day, and the stress from my job is insane. 
In a nutshell, he is constantly depressed, it’s always stemming from a new reason, and for the last couple of years it’s been loneliness. I can only be here as much as I possibly can between working full time and my daughter wanting all of my attention when I am home. I feel like I have NOTHING more I can possibly offer, and that answer is just not good enough for him. He always always always wants to talk about it, and I just don’t have an answer! I’m starting to feel like I’m not the right person for him. 
Side note: he has tried medication in the past and it was amazingly helpful but he doesn’t like the idea of being someone else because medication makes him a certain way - basically he sees it as ‘medicated him’ is not actually himself. His mother is also a prescription drug addict so he’s very against medication.  

SORRY for the long post, ten years of being with someone is a lot to wrap up and this is just a glimpse of our problems."
916,"I (18 Female) am in my first year of college and I got close to a guy. To be honest I was attracted to him but when I found out he had a gf I set boundaries for myself and thought of him like a friend (I cut off my attraction). We got closer and we start messaging everyday. Like every morning and night we greet each other and we are in the same classes so we hangout and go eat with our friends a lot. Since I didnt know anybody in the school he was my closest friend and relied on him a lot. One time our friend group drank at his house and things did happen between us when we were drunk like we cuddles and kissed but I didn't think much of it cuz we were drunk. I didnt let that affect me and I didnt put any meaning to it. 

Our friendship continued past that with no awkwardness until a week or two later he just stopped messaging me. I thought it was weird so I waited but days became weeks and then he would avoid eye contact with me in school and only talk to me if in a group or if necessary. I was so confused and hurt cuz a friend just ghosted me. After waiting for so long I got the courage to ask him what's wrong and he just said he's been busy. 

So idk what happened between us cuz on my end he was always a friend but I guess from his end there was something else?  I feel like he should be honest and straightforward with me with how he is feeling/thinking so I can understand and help. I feel left in the dark to wonder what happened. Am I in the wrong because all I wanted was friendship and I thought that's what we had? I thought he thought of me as a friend cuz he's already taken? Is he in the wrong for not telling me anything and just ignoring me? Are we both in the wrong?  Idk I'm dense and oblivious as fuck so any ideas and advice?

For extra info: He still is distant but we still talk sometimes in the classroom. We don't message anymore so it feels like strangers or acquaintances. I'm still kinda sad (but almost over it) cuz I enjoyed our convos. But there are times where times he is confusing  like when he acts bitter whenever i talk about a guy friend? Idk guys are confusing"
917,"Tl:Dr at the end and I am using a throwaway because thats what I use for my advice questions

So as the title states, I’m getting harassed at school. Sexual harassment to be specific. I’ve started documenting dates and details of the incidents and each incident has witnesses. But the thing is, the person doing it has Aspergers and him and his brother use that as an excuse every time they get in trouble for something. Including getting others in trouble just for the hell of it. Which is why I’m afraid to say anything for fear it’ll get dismissed because they have Aspergers. I had been planning on saying something after the first incident but then something happened that made me start doubting myself.

Just the other day, we were all joking around at lunch about one of then whacking it in the bathroom which was witnessed by multiple people so it wasn’t just a silly rumor and last night they told administration that we were bullying them. Keep in mind though that the brother added things about his brother to the conversation and was laughing the entire time. Administration took no one else’s words but theirs into account and got all of us in trouble for “bullying”. We had never brought it up to them before or even said anything about it to anyone so I don’t understand why they felt the need to tattle about it. This threw off my plans to say anything because if they’re going to believe the word of one person over five others, why would they believe mine?

I have a record of several different occurrences of one of them touching me inappropriately and starring at my boobs despite being told to stop and making me wildly uncomfortable and I wrote it all down and dated it and I was planning on taking it to administration but now I’m too scared to. What if it gets dismissed because he had Aspergers and “he cant help it” and they bank on that excuse and I get dismissed? What if it only gets worse after? I have several witnesses to each event but if there were 6 people involved in the last event and they took the word of one whats my word against theirs? I don’t want it to seem like I’m tattling as revenge for them tattling on me and my friends so I was gonna wait a little but I don’t know if thats the best course of action.

Tl;Dr: I’m getting sexually harassed at school and I’m too afraid to say anything now because they have Aspergers and have used it to get away with things in the past.

I don’t know what I should do in this situation and any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
918,"I’m kinda new to tinder, I matched with one of my friends that I’ve known for a few years. We used to be great friends in high school, but now we rarely talk. What’s the case when friends match? Are they actually interested, or do friends usually just swipe right on each other?"
919,I feel like this is cheating because you interact with them. On this particular app you subscribe by friending them. He had 150+women subscribed to him. Is this cheating? Should I leave or forgive? If I forgive how do I move forward in our realationship? How do I get my confidence back?
920,"I (27F) have been dating my gf (30) for 3 months. I know it’s still early but I feel like I’m not getting to know her any better. We did start off as a one night stand that turned into a friends with benefit and now a relationship. We like each other a lot, spend time with each other’s families and friends. It could be because I’m more used to going on dates and getting to know someone before I get intimate. How do we get closer emotionally?"
921,"My anxiety issues have been getting worse lately. Just last week I talked to him about it, told him I needed to get help because I felt it was affecting me and our relationship, I told him I didn’t want to lose him. He reassured me he wasn’t going anywhere, he wanted to make me happy for as long as I wanted him to. A few days later I asked a stupid, insecure question. I don’t know why I did it, but it made him angry and hurt. He distanced himself for a few days, and then told me he couldn’t do this anymore. I saw him just yesterday to give him his things and his eyes were swollen from crying. We hugged each other tight, coming back in for hugs 3 different times. We parted with him giving me 3 forehead kisses in a row like he’d always done before. He still loves me, I still love him. I am so pissed I didn’t get help sooner. When we were together, things were great. He said I made him the happiest he’s ever been, and he made me feel the same. My fucking insecurities and anxieties ruined the best relationship I’ve ever had. Knowing he still loves me, do I give him space and contact him in a couple weeks to see if he wants to hang out? Or do I just leave him alone forever? 

TL;DR My (33f) boyfriend (33m) ended things with me because my anxiety issues were getting worse. He still loves me, so do I contact him in a few weeks to see if he wants to hang out or do I let go forever?"
922,"I’m a 23 year old male and have met a girl on tinder. We have seen each other 3 times now and slept with each other on the 3rd date. I noticed a week ago i couldn’t see her on tinder anymore. I asked her if she deleted it and she said yes. 

I out of curiosity created another account to see if she was lying and I couldn’t see her so I thought she was telling the truth


. Two days ago I checked out it paranoia and I saw her pop up, meaning she is still on tinder but unmatched with me. Maybe it is a glitch on tinder? Any help would be much appreciated thank you."
923,"Hi guys,

so my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now. We both have October birthdays, his is the 5th and mines the 26th. This year we are both turning 21 (well he already did) anyways, for his birthday the night before while he was at work I decorated our place with balloons and a poster and some streamers from the ceiling and made him chicken Cordon Bleu and a homemade salad for dinner and got him his favorite whiskey. I also got him a Browning hat and sweatshirt on top of some things to help train our dog to be a hunting dog, my boyfriend is super into this kind of stuff, hes a marine. This was all the night before his actually bday. On his actual birthday we had a party with all of his friends and he was shitfaced by 9 o’clock throwing up and falling in and out of sleep as you would expect. I was helping him drink water or holding the trashcan and just be in his room with him while I told his buddies to keep partying because I know he’d get back out there which he did around 10/11ish. anyways, then the next day after his birthday we went to bass pro shop because like I said before he’s into the stuff and I basically gave him $150 to get whatever he wanted (we talked about doing this when we first started dating, so I couldn’t take my word back) in the store and we spent about five hours there. It was all so much fun and I don’t regret doing any of it because I love to spoil people that I love and make them just feel like it’s only about them especially on somebody’s birthday. mine obviously is right around the corner and about a week ago when I got home from work he surprised me with getting planter boxes and some soil and seeds to grow some vegetables because I’ve been talking about that for a while and he said it was my birthday present and it had to come early because this is a good time to start planting things. He currently is away right now visiting his family in another state and I decided to not take that time off so I could work before my birthday and make some money so I can go out and have some fun. On my birthday we had planned to go to the restaurant I work at and get some drinks because everyone wants to buy me drinks but he just told me that he has to work now and he won’t be off until around five but I have a family dinner about 45 minutes away at 6 o’clock which I obviously can’t be late too because it’s my birthday dinner. he said the planter boxes were my gift which is soo sweet and thoughtful but.. like i feel like its annoying of me to be upset with that. whether people like to believe it or not they like to feel special especially on their birthdays and idk i just feel like he doesnt maybe care as much because I requested his birthday weekend off and put so much effort into making sure he felt as good as he makes me feel. so idk, hes gone the whole week before my bday and works the weekend of it when he originally told me he’d have it off. I’m not mad at him I just feel a little under appreciated but I don’t know if that’s a valid feelings or not or if I’m just being annoying. i know guys arent the best at this kinda stuff and im not discarding the planter boxes but he put work into that but idk.. like maybe being there on my birthday would be nice.."
924,I dont know whether I should have like a little October recap message to my girlfriend. We have been dating since 27/9/19 and I have kept a list of things weve done this month and have had the idea of doing a little message for her to read and remember... Is this a good idea?
925,"My boyfriend of one year is very suicidal, he's attempted suicide numerous times and once whilst we were together. he currently doesn't study or work and is living with his abusive mother who threatens to kick him out daily and makes his life a constant living hell.  When he's depressed I try my best to make him feel better but I genuinely struggle as im not used to nor good at cheering others up in such a situation. he brings up suicide to me almost everyday and he seems genuinely serious about ending it all. he has no aspirations or goals and claims his only happiness in life is me. When we first started dating I genuinely thought he was the one but after less than two months we started arguing nonstop almost every single day and it made me and him very miserable, he's controlling and emotionally and mentally abusive. We're very different people and we disagree on many things which I presume is the cause of most of our arguments. I feel as if im in a one way relationship because I've lost my feelings for him, I think I would be happier without him I feel emotionally drained 24/7 however I feel like I can't leave because he's told me that if I did ever leave he would kill himself as he wouldn't have a purpose in life anymore. im lying about my feelings towards him because a future with me is the only reason he's alive. im trapped I don't know what to do, I don't want him to attempt suicide because of me he's very vulnerable and serious about doing it. currently we're in a long distance relationship he lives 7 hours away from me."
926,"So we've been together 4 years, live together, love each other loads and we're planning on getting engaged in the new year. Apologies in advance for text wall. 

He's just started a job as a police officer and he's terrified about it, he's policing London in an area which is known for gangs and stabbings. A few weeks ago he got extremely drunk at a wedding and finally opened up to me about how scared he is (which was strange because we normally talk about everything, and he never gets drunk, but I think he's been feeling pressure to be an equal contributer to the relationship so can't quit and feels he's a man so not allowed be scared etc etc etc, even though he has a pretty modern perspective on gender we all internalise the expectations). That night, when he was super drunk and kept throwing up, I took him back to the house we were staying in to make sure he was okay and was trying with all my might to get him to drink even a sip of water - you know when you're too sick to want water but the person looking after you KNOWS it's the only thing that will make you feel better. He got very aggressive with me, shouting and swearing (which is incredibly out of character), so much so his mum came in the room to check I was okay. In the morning we talked and he was very apologetic, he hadn't realised how bad he'd been (in his drunk mind he thought he was just talking normally).

Then a week or so I was super stressed about work, and he shouted at me so much in an argument about that/housework/washing up that he made me cry. Again he was very apologetic and begging me to forgive him afterwards. 

I've seen the way his Dad talks to his mum when he's having trouble he has with his temper (""shut up Woman"") and I really don't want that to be my future. On the other hand, his Dad is a wonderful and loving man who has had a difficult childhood and occasionally loses it, and his Mum is a lovely, very intelligent woman who has clearly decided that she's okay with being spoken to that way sometimes as long as he apologises, as that's a part of him that she has to accept and loves him anyway. 

I've (half jokingly) told SO that my bags will be packed within seconds if he ever speaks to me like that. But now he has spoken to me like that (and apologised profusely) and I'm not sure what to do. Do I just decide to be understanding about the fact that he's incredibly stressed/ terrified/ feels a lot of pressure at the moment/ is at least doing better than his father and cut him some slack? Or do I see it as a red flag? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much for your help."
927,"We’ve been pretty wishy washy since April. In April, he kissed another girl who had a boyfriend at the time. After the kiss, him and I broke up. She and her boyfriend broke up. They were together until just recently. Every few weeks he would contact me even though he had a girlfriend. He would tell me he missed me and wanted to see me frequently. I told him I wasn’t comfortable hanging out with him, because he was with her still. I think the lines got blurred along the way and he began to lie to me about him still being in a relationship with her. Every few weeks he’s with her, every few weeks he tells me they’re broken up and he contacts me. 

This past weekend, he broke up with her “for sure”. So, I went over to his apartment, we had sex, and it was great. We hung out again last night. This morning, he texts me that is hanging out again feels forced and unnatural. He wants to work on himself and his mental health before being with anyone. I told him that I understand, but I am tired of him telling me he has to work on himself and running back to her (because this isn’t the first time this has happened, probably the third time). I say of course I want him to work on his mental health, but i am unclear of where I fit into his situation. He asks me “why I would want to be with someone who is unhappy”? And I tell him “I just want to be there to support him and help him along the way” and that I just want to “help put him in a happy environment when I’m around”. He responds with “well, it’s not working”. He continues by saying, “I don’t want you to resent or block me”. I continue to ask if he wants my help. He says he needs to be alone. I tell him okay, but for my mental peace, I need to block his number. I can’t be pulled out of my life situation and have it all jumbled up every time he wants to hit me up. He continues and says “how am I supposed to talk to you if you’re waiting for me?” Which leaves me a little confused so I ask if he wants me to “wait” for him? I don’t understand what that entails? I’ve sort of been put out on the side anyway, “waiting” because he had a whole relationship with another girl. 

Is this childish to block him? I know I probably should’ve forgotten about the whole situation when he kissed someone else and had a whole ass relationship with them. 

Tdlr; ex wants space, but doesn’t want me to block his number. I want to block his number. Is this childish?"
928,"The Rock: So I don't know if this is the best place to post this but I don't know where else to go. So the story goes that there's a girl that I have become pretty close with. We have become really good friends and really enjoy each other's company. The problem is that I have developed very strong feelings for this girl. She just got out of a long term relationship and it did not end well, so she isn't really looking to be with anyone and I totally understand this. I have seen first hand how hard its affecting her and I know she isn't ready to jump into anything and I have no intention pressuring her into anything. I feel its also important to mention that she is aware that I have feelings for her, I'm just not sure she knows how strong those feelings really are. The issue that I'm having is that I can't stop thinking about her! I want to be with her so badly and being friends is just getting harder and harder! I refuse to try to push her into anything or start giving ultimatums. I would never do that to her. So I'm left just wanting to be with someone I can't be with and it sucks!! To me, the logical thing to do is just to end the friendship and get over her. Its not fair to her or to me to be in this situation....but there's another side to this coin...
The Hard Place: I suffer from MDD which is triggered by the feeling of lonliness. When I feel lonely I fall into this pit of depression...I find it hard to do anything...even get out of bed. She has really been helping with that. Since her and I have been getting close my depression has been getting better. I've been feeling more energetic and just generally in a better mood. I find myself wanting get out and try new things! She's going to teach me how to snowboard this season which is something I never saw myself doing in the past and I'm excited about it! She really has been a huge help and I am so grateful for that! But she's kind of all I got...I don't make friends easily and since I moved to a new state I'm having an even harder time! She's basically my only friend and now that I'm considering ending it I'm getting that feeling of lonliness again...that without her I have no one and I'm just going to be alone forever...but perhaps I've become too dependant on her...
None of this is her fault. I don't want her feeling any obligations to me and I don't want her to feel like she has to be with me for my sake so I avoid telling her about this. But what should I do? Should I keep the friendship going and just hope my feelings go away or should I just end the friendship and just suffer through the depression and lonliness? What I really want to do is what's best for her but 1. What is best for her? and 2. Should I take my own well being into account at all? Help!!"
929,"We have been living together for two years now and have been dating for 4 years. Im a bit nervous posting on here, I might be in my own head about all of this but I just want to write it all out to get my thoughts together, and maybe get some other opinions. 

Anyway, we are both full time students in college. I knew from the first year that he was a slacker, but I didn’t really care much for it because I kind of was as well. As second year came on, I picked up my slack and am more responsible with my work while he is just the same. If anything he seems less motivated and quite honestly his lack of motivation to pursue school or anything important kinda messes up my image of him. Just his way of being at the moment is so unattractive. 

I noticed that he avoids getting any sort of work done. He just slumps around and doesn’t really do much of anything everyday. It’s quite depressing getting home and seeing him on the couch. I mean there are days where he cleans, cooks, and does sweet stuff for me. But, I notice myself just seeing him in a sort of gross light. 

We always made fun of little kids who vaped like “vaping is for people to help them stop smoking... “ . He’s recently picked it up, I assume for fun ? He says it’s just become a habit. And he also picked up drinking, he drinks quite a lot. I think he’s drank a bottle of wine everyday for the past 4 days now. It’s worrying and I hate it. I am not a big fan of smoking and drinking -which he has always know. I allow him to do whatever he wants because I don’t want to be controlling in any sort of way. I also think that he can make his own decisions. 
I have mentioned my issues with his drinking before, saying that I personally don’t like him drinking everyday (the vaping is fine I don’t really mention that, it’s just odd seeing him do it so often). He’s responded by telling my to mind my own business. It also seems like he gets offended when I tell him how I’m feeling towards his behaviour so he seems to do it more? If that makes sense. Almost out of spite.

While this is only a portion of what is happening. I just find myself so unenthused with the route he’s taking. I’m worried about him but I know if I were to have a serious sit down with him, he’ll just walk away and not want to listen. 

Am I wrong for how I’m feeling towards him? Im also thinking my story is so one sided I’m sure his side of the story would probably be like “I’m avoiding my work, I just don’t want to do it, i want to escape with drinking...” I don’t know! Let me know if you want any more details about anything.
How do I go about this ? Any advice would be helpful?"
930,"As the tilte says my girlfriend spends more time with someone else and ignores me. She stays home most of the time playing videogames and talking on discord. I didn't have a problem with it since we played together a lot. However lately she has been ignoring me not replying to my texts or if she replies its usually 4-5hours later.
I've talked with that guy and he said that he was 'over' with the feelings for her but I pretty certain he was lying.  I don't want to break up because I love her but it hurts me that she just ignores me lately. 

What should I do?"
931,"A few days ago we were texting while I was on break and he was at home and he asked me randomly if I still talked to our friend Derick (we met him a year ago at a small party of college friends BEFORE I started dating my boyfriend, so exchanging numbers with Dereck as friends and texting him was not wrong of me to do at the time)

I explained that last month Dereck had started being fickle and rude at times for no reason and it made conversations stressful so I just stopped interacting with him. 

He asked me ""Is he important to you?"" Which caught me off guard and felt very random considering the fact that neither of us have talked about Dereck since we last saw him like three months ago. I told him ""Not very, but I don't hate him. I hope he's doing well.""

And the my boyfriend told me about how he didn't like seeing Dereck's comments on my older posts and he thought that he was ""being too friendly"" and seeing my posts ""too fast, like he was waiting for them""

This conversation was very uncomfortable and weird for me and after awhile my boyfriend asked me what I used to text Dereck about. I explained that we only really talked about work, music, and occasionally vented to each other about life problems. My boyfriend asked to see text screenshots as proof and I complied.

He THEN explained to me in great detail that Dereck was way too nice to me and that he ""knows how men think"" and he said that Dereck was a creep for asking me how my day went too often and complimenting my work ethic (what the fuck?)

His main argument was that ""If you were a man, would he be this nice to you?"" and he basically forced me to block him on social media. When I initially didn't want to he demanded ""Do you need him? Why does it matter so much that you keep him in your contacts?""

I couldn't argue. He turned it on me and made me feel guilty. 

He then informed me that because he knows how men think and I don't, I'm welcome (and expected) to tell him *the next time I'm not sure whether I can trust a male friend* so he can judge my text conversations and let me know.

I've been very close with my boyfriend for a long time and he's never been this possessive or jealous before. I don't know what triggered it but he is insisting that he only wants to protect me because I'm ""his"" and I feel a little worried and afraid of this happening again 

I know he cherishes me and wants me to be his and I like that, but this feels like too much. I told him this and he brushed it off and said he would never try to control me. Isn't that what just happened though? I feel crazy


TL;DR My boyfriend just made me cut off a male friend of mine ""to protect me"" because he thinks I was being hit on."
932,I have classes with this girl that likes me and she texted me asking me if i wanted to go out with here. I dont think im ready for a relationship since i recently had a bad break up. I m not sure what to  tell her
933,"Let's start with some backstory. I (male 15) have liked this girl (girl 17 but still a sophomore like me)  for some time (I'm in 10th grade and I have liked her since 9th. We slowly became friends as time passed. I told a friend that I liked her, and he started pining after her. He got with her, but all was still well. I moved on a few weeks later. Now they've broken up but I've grown more intense feelings for her. I like her but I can't really tell if she likes me. I think she still likes her ex-bf but he's blocked her and wants nothing to do with her. I would love some advice. Feel free to ask anything as I will try to answer to give everyone a better understanding."
934,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and a half. During that time, he's probably gone out with his friends at least once or twice every month. Which is fine, I'm not stopping him.

But meanwhile, there's somehow never enough money for me to go out. (Edit: I do work full time and make my own paychecks, however he kind of controls my bank too and I guess I didn't realize it but someone said ""gives me an allowance"" even though its my money too. I just don'twant to get into the financial because it's complicated and would be a whole post in itself) Anyways, in the whole relationship I've gone out one time with friends. And that was to the mall. He had said he would work doordash and give me some money, but that didn't happen so I just walked around with them and watched them eat when they decided they where hungry because I had no money to eat with them. 

This hit me harder than it would a lot of people because of an abusive childhood where my parents often go out to eat at nice places with my brother and I would be forced to watch them eat all this yummy food and then go home and have a pb and j. So I kind of wanted to cry the whole everyone was eating because I had nothing to do and it would've been rude to go on my phone, and it just reminded me of my parents. So while I enjoyed going out, it wasn't overall the the best experience for me.

Cut to now, a couple of work friends invited me out again. They bought a 4 pack tickets to the Haunted hotel and only had 3 people so if I came I could get the ticket for free. Awesome! I finally get to do something fun.

I ask my boyfriend if I can go because it's during a time when he's off work and would usually visit me. He ignores me. So I'm ask why are you mad. And he's like ""go if you want I guess"" but I could tell he was mad. 
So I kinda got mad too like whats your problem its one day, and I literally never get to go out. And then he says well you could've invited me.

I do want to say there has been plenty of things he's gone too without me.. 

I was like okay well its their thing Ill ask. I did ask but they where kind of uncomfortable because I mean it is kind of rude when they offer a free ticket for me to come to be like, and can my boyfriend come too?  
He did used to work with 2 of the 3 a long time ago but it's not like they ever really talked or where friends. And last time I invited him to a thing with all of them he got offended and was like ""why would I want to hang out with THEM?"" So honestly I didn't even think he'd want to come.

Finally after talking a little because he's acting butthurt and saying I don't want him there and I'm trying to say I do but I'm not sure they'd be comfortable with it. And that I'd be happy to go with him but we can't afford buying 2 tickets on our own and I don't want to say no to going because of that. Especially when I never get to go out and he does. I kind of figured I deserve to go out at least once.

So finally he says its okay after I point out my going out once vs his monthly visits. And even says hell give me some money for food and hed cone get me if they got drunk or something happened. 

Then last night one of the people text me that it's off because they got into a fight. I tell my boyfriend, he says ok but he's still going to visit his cousin after work but he'll see me after. Which is fine, I'm not going to stop him. 

Then this morning when I wake up, they made up I guess because they're going again so I tell my boyfriend and he reads it and doesn't answer. He comes online a few times so I'm like ok? Which he also reads but says nothing.  So I'm wondering why if he's online why he didn't say anything. I kind of figure its because hes mad. Because thats what he does. 
He later said it was because he was busy at work but I'm still not sure why you'd be on your phone at all if you where busy. I don't take my phone out at work unless I have a moment. But whatever. 

He then says he doesn't want me to go anymore because I'm inconsiderate changing plans like that. And he should break up because he has to change his plans and blah blah. Even though he said he wasn't changing his plans just because mine did? So what is he talking about
Last night I told him we whernt going at like 12am. And then I woke up at 10 and said we are. He was sleeping most of that time and had said he was still going to see his cousin?

We fight a little because I'm like what the fuck so he calms down a bit but then he says its because he doesn't trust them. I'm like why? It's one guy who we're both 99% sure is a closet gay (nothing wrong with this) and even if he wasn't, he wouldn't be my type anyways and then 2 girls. Its not like we where going to a strip club or even drinking. 

He says its because of the fight and what if they fight again. I say this is highly unlikely because there will be 2 other people, me and the other girl so I don't think they'd be fighting with us there if they already made up. 
He says well okay but the guy could get butthurt and abandon you there. To which I'm like I seriously doubt that. He wouldn't just be abandoning me but 2 other girls far from home. And 2 of us wouldn't even be involved in thier fight. He doesn't seem like that kind of person. And my bf just offered yesterday to get me and now he wouldn't?

TDLR: My boyfriend is trying to not let me go out for a Halloween activity with a few work friends. What should I do?"
935,"So I've had this friend/roommate for 2 years now. We started out as good friends (don't wanna use the term close loosely) but slowly I've noticed that I think I'm irritating to them. Some personalities don't mesh, I totally get that. We have a lot of good times but I can see it in their eyes when they're tired of me talking or sharing. For the past two years they've also been dealing with some form of depression and they've been using weed a lot to try and combat it. (No qualms against the beautiful flower but at a certain point their use got desperate/dependent.) They'd have moments where they couldn't be themselves without weed. If they weren't high they would be like a stranger to me, only answering in one word sentences. But they would act totally different and nice with other friends (which honestly makes me jealous). We don't even hang out as much anymore. Then I started noticing that they would be interested in talking to me but only after they've gotten high. I'm a little sensitive as a person but I've been growing a backbone since college started. I get irritated when my friendship and effort aren't reciprocated but I also feel bad wanting to have a break from them because I know they've been dealing with depression. I feel as if it would be okay for me to part ways because they have a partner they confide in (they're practically best friends!). I should note that we (me, friend, partner) are all in the same friend group.

Overall I'm feeling emotionally drained and I have never brought this up to them. I don't know how to ask ""Hey do you still like me as a friend?"" without it being really awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Am I wrong for wanting to take a break from them for my own emotional capacity? And should I bring this up to them or wait until I move out at the end of the year?"
936,"We've been dating for \~6 months, both on the west coast. Things look good and we both see a future. That doesn't mean engaged in 6 months but we're definitely also not the people to wait 3 years to get engaged either. She's been looking for a job, and in her line of work she'll probably have to work a lot of hours and travel a bit. She got an offer in a city in the NE (think Bos, NY) and wants to move out there because it is an amazing opportunity for her.

I'd obviously have loved it if she stayed where I am, but she's gotta do what's best for her career. I work for a pretty big tech company, so luckily the company I work for does have a small office in the city she's in. If I'm unable to transfer, I work in tech so odds are I could still find a decent job with comparable pay, in some regard.

Regarding whether I have the right to move over there for her: the big thing is, moving for someone like that is a big deal. She has also expressed worry about expectations, that she would be worried that since I moved, I would expect things from her. I told her I wouldn't do this, but I acknowledge the possibility of hating my new job or the area and the potential for that to cause arguments between us. I don't see it happening but I acknowledge it could. But, because of these worries, she's almost thinking it would be better to do distance. I told her if she has the right to move there to pursue a career, then if I (or we) are both committed to the relationship, I have just as much a right to move over there to be with her, even if it would cause added pressure. Is this unfair? I know it's going to add pressure to her, but I mean I love her so if I want to move, I should be allowed to, right? She has to accept that she made her decision, and so I should have the right that she has to accept that I am going to make mine? Not sure how to think about that.

The second part of the question is pretty much whether its crazy though on my end to do this. It's only been \~6 months, and would be \~9 months by the time I'd wanna move, but I do feel very strongly. I wouldn't be giving up too much in terms of job prospects or salary, but I would be leaving where I live so I'd be in a brand new place with no family or friends. I've done distance before and do not want to do it again."
937,"So my man (50) and I (28) have been together almost 5years I’ve always felt like a team with him we got a kid together(15months) but I really feel like he does the absolute bare minimum to take care of us my car is a peice of crap that he bought. But when I worked we saved 10grand and got him a truck and then I had my son and he bought me 2700 dollar car we got our moneys worth now it’s having problems his truck broke down for like 3months in the shop and he used my car left trash all in it never cleaned it or fixed any issues with it and still to this day not. Now he’s wanting a new truck and to fix my car but probably won’t. I do everything a house wife can do for a man and he won’t even take the trash out or fix my car, or anything wrong with the house. Am I just a negative woman that needs to be greatful or am I right when I say if a man loves his woman she comes first and he makes sure she’s good. If his friends asked him for anything he jumps right to it me nope he does it whenever he wants. I just think I should be treated better if this is how all men are this sucks. My parents were not like this my dad does anything for my mom and buys her new car before him please help me figure out how to handle this situation I don’t want to leave him but something has to give"
938,"I highly doubt he knows me Reddit username so no throwaway but oh well. 

We have been dating about two years now, both in our mid-twenties. I've been living with him not long now and we use his spare notebooks for scratch paper for notes and lists. I went through one to find a blank page to use and came across some poems about girls and one of which was super graphic. I'm pretty sure these were about girls before me but I'm so uncomfortable about these. Its also got me wondering if any of these could be about me... 

I don't want to confront him so he will do something about them but I want to be able to talk to him about how I feel without him feeling like crap about it. 

How should I go about telling him about this?"
939,"so im homeschooled for the first time and i hate it. its made me so depressed and i've lost all of my friends and i dont ever get to leave the house. i havent went anywhere but to the grocery store since june when summer started. well all week my mom has been on me about my grades which are terrible. i used to be a straight A student but now i dont have the motivation to do anything. i keep telling her to put me back in public school and i'll do better and she refuses. well all week any time i do something or say anything she goes off on me and today she busted in my room because of an email i got a month ago saying i need to show progress in my classes. she started yelling at me and i said ""i dont know why youre mad because im depressed and hate it here and ive told you this and you wont do anything to help me."" we ended up throwing things at each other and she told me she hated me and took the brand new phone i just got even though i payed for it. she has never paid for any of my things. my family already hates me and i dont have anyone. im thinking about killing myself because i dont know what else to do. she also took my school laptop because when i use youtube i 'take all the wifi' but my sister and her are on youtube and netflix all day."
940,"We have been together a little over a month. While we were out watching “The Joker” last night I was suddenly overwhelmed with how much I adore him. I rarely do relationships, but with him everything feels different and exciting and beautiful. Is that the kind of thing you normally would tell a guy you’ve been going out with for a month or would it be weird? Help reddit. I’m lost about how these things go."
941,"I (30F) have a good friend and former college roommate (30F) - let’s call her Kim - who has had a rough couple of years.  Kim has had a very serious health issue requiring years of treatment in addition to having her fiancé leave her only a few months before the wedding early this year.  I was extremely supportive to Kim during this time - driving to her house “just because”, taking her out, listening to her, supporting her, planning girls nights and trips, etc.  I still feel it is my job to help her through this difficult time and understand our friendship is essentially a one way street.  However, since this time she’s been going out partying every night of the week and dating really poor choices in men.  I didn’t say anything critical because I didn’t think it’s my place and I knew she was going through a rough time.

I’ve moved away and Kim came to visit recently.  We had a generally good time, but any time I’d bring up my life/job/feelings or husband in the normal course of conversation, she would make a negative comment about it (i.e. - What are you complaining about, at least you have a husband!) and change the topic to something about her life.  Any time we didn’t do something she wanted (i.e.- Stay out later to drink), she would complain and bring it back to her life/problems.  I continued to be supportive and listen and tell her to take it one day at a time and everything will work out but nothing really changed.  Finally, after a few days of this behavior,  I told her I didn’t appreciate her bad behavior and she burst out crying.  I felt like the bad guy and we chatted about her life and how everything is still affecting her (naturally) and I tried to be supportive.

My questions are- do I finally tell her the truth (and accept the consequences) that her bad decisions lately are contributing to the negativity around her life?  Am I the bad guy for not wanting a friendship that seems to be a one way street (although she’s been through a lot)? 

It’s absolutely draining... help!"
942,"He wants me to have another baby and be a stay at home “wife”

I quoted wife because we’re not married, we’ve been together for 8 years and we have 2 kids together. I finally have a decent job making about a grand every two weeks. I work between 40 to 60 hours a week. But now my bf wants me to stop working and stay home to take care of the children.

For years he’s badger me about getting a job and once I do every time! He complains that I’m not making enough money or that I’m not helping him enough with the bills. Now he wants me to quit my job because he says.... his exact reasoning btw

“So he can see me more often, have unlimited sex with me, so the house can always be clean, and so I can give him more babies, and he doesn’t have to worry about whether or not I’m going to work.”

That’ll never work out! It almost feels as if he doesn’t want me to be independent or to depend on him for finances or anything that I need.

I just wanted to know if it’s a good idea. Plus we’re behind on bills already about 1300$ in rent ........."
943,"I'm getting married next year, and my fiance asked me about hyphenating her last name. I don't want her too, I am very against it, but I don't have a real reason, and I told her that, I told her it's a show of commitment, but I started thinking, why? 

Do any other men feel the same way? Does anyone know why this is something we want? Is there some sort of primal psychology behind it or something?"
944,Ok so there is this girl I like she goes to my school and I like her but I was talking to this other girl she goes to another school that close by and I kinda like her but I’m not sure what to do because I like one at my school but I don’t want to be mean to the other girl and turn her away please help me out 🙏😰😰 they are both 17 I’m 18
945,"And they're already spoken for. 
  
I've (27m) fallen rather hard for a girl (22f) whose already in a relationship. Is there a ""proper"" way to convey this to her? I don't expect her to leave her current relationship, but I don't want to regret not saying anything for the next decade either. I realize it'd be the end of our current friendship, but I can't handle her as ""just a friend"", that's not what I want out of this."
946,"So basically-

Me and this guy met off tinder. We messaged loads before we hooked up- continuously throughout the day. We were both on a night out and seen each other so we ended up hooking up It went really well and was super chill. However- I caught the feels. I really liked him but played it chill. He was extremely distant after but I just left it.

He then messaged me asking me out on a date. I really liked him again and thought we were both adult enough to have sex and still have respect for each other (big mistake).

He didn't text me for 1.5 days (I know- not a big deal but I guess because of his texting habits prior it was a kick in the gut). I genuinely liked this guy and I know this seems fast (it's not often I like guys this quick which is what surprises me most about this and makes it harder).

Anyway- feeling upset I stupidly messaged him asking why he didn't just tell me he wanted Casual Sex instead of dressing it up as a date.

He asked where all this was coming from and how he didn't know I would feel this way because he didn't text. I guess for me it's just a respect thing- if I went on a date I would text them either later in the day or the next day. It literally takes 1 minute to say, 'hey yesterday was fun, I enjoyed it' or 'hey, sorry but I just don't feel like we would work out'.

He also said he didn't want to text too soon in case it got out of hand- my response being 'out of hand-- haha, what even??'- like god forbid you send someone a text and they reply.. so crazy and out of hand.

Anyway, I've completed fucked this up and just wonder from a guys perspective or girls - would you ever respond to someone who brought this up again?

(He has left me on read after 'out of hand-- what even?' -  I won't be texting again). 

I'm taking it as an L just to move on and learn for the next time.  I know I fucked up by mentioning it and I agree- it was only 1 day. Guess his previous texting habits just threw me a bit and just the respect aspect &amp; being straightforward?"
947,"Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been talking/joking around about hall passes for a while now. It seems like we’re both on equal terms about this, but before I start thinking about it seriously I wanted to get some opinions. 

It’s been mentioned a few times over the past year (we’ve been together 2+ years and intend to be together for as long as possible) from equal sides. Before it was kind of a thing that would’ve benefited him more than me, but I brought it up recently as I think it’d benefit us equally now. 

Next week I’m going to a party in Leeds (3+ hours from me) and he intends to go to a club with his friends in London. I don’t even know if I’d use the hall pass, but i feel like this would be a good opportunity to try it out. 

It’s more of a ‘when you miss being single, love being in a relationship, but want to have the opportunity to walk in a place and know the world is your oyster’ kind of thing, rather than ‘I want to have sex with other people’ thing - does that make sense? 

Some answers to questions I assume people have - 

- we’re on good terms, our relationship is fun, we live together, we have more than great sex

- we probably wouldn’t speak about if we used our hall pass/any details about if we did etc, just a night of being ‘single’ and then we go back to our normal relationship 

- there’s no chance we would get with anyone the other person knows / or for it to last longer than the one night 

Do you think there is a chance one of us will like it a little bit too much? But then if we’re on agreed terms surely this won’t be a problem? 

I’ll of course speak to him more in detail about this before deciding anything - but I’d love to hear what people think / experiences of people in open relationships"
948,"

So lately it seems that anytime my SO and I have problems that the conversations are one sided. I say conversations because they aren’t really arguments. At least at first. Usually what happens is SO will start to act really sad out of no where and have a lot of negative thoughts about their self. I don’t really know where these even come from and we’ve been together for a little over 2 years. I just don’t see those same things that SO does. It tears me up on the inside knowing they feel that way and all I want to do is understand why. If I had that understanding at the least, maybe then I could know if there was something I could do to help.

I wish she could see really how stunning she is. It makes me very sad that she doesn’t see her significance to me or other people in her life. It seems that she doesn’t want help. Or mine at least. I feel that way because she won’t ever open up to me. 

Sorry for the long post and format..."
949,"About to quit cloth diapering

So, I started cloth diapering for financial reasons, we are living paycheck to paycheck with excess expenses piling up on credit cards. I felt guilty for the start up cost NOW my husband decides he wants the Apple Watch 5 and gets it. Here I am trying to make every fucking penny count and he just doesn’t give a fuck. Just like his family he is R selected, absolutely cannot delay gratification. I was actually saving up on the side to get for him as a Christmas gift. Hoping it may have a small discount for Black Friday or something. Ugh, anyways why am I going  through the pain of hand washing!!!! (Because we don’t have a washer dryer) Flats and inserts every day to saves us like a few bucks a month when he doesn’t care about spending $500. 

I’m pissed, but mainly disappointment since I hinted on this stupid watch being his Christmas gift. At moments like this I really regret marrying this man and having a kid. Btw, it’s not the first time. Last time he ordered the latest iPhone, just because, and before that bought a  new truck... which is the fucken reason the money isn’t enough!!! But GOD fucking forbid I say anything about it because then I’m just a nagging bitch that doesn’t let him enjoy anything and sucks the joy out of his life. 

So in the hopes of avoiding another fight, here I am ranting: I just decided, I need to keep things amicable, raise this baby and then get out of dodge.

I am not co-signing shit. What else should I do to avoid being drowned in debt?"
950,"I met my best friend freshman year of college. We used to spend so much time talking about random things and just hanging out. Then we got together, and we dated for a little, and it was good, but he left for study abroad. When he came back we decided to date again, but now that we are dating after not seeing each other for so long, it feels like that connection got lost. I am more saddened by the fact that I lost my best friend, rather than the fact that our relationship isn’t going too well. How should I go about this?"
951,"Hey,. Me (26M) and my Ex GF (26F) broke up and ended an 8 year relationship around 6 months ago. She broke up with me through text which I still can’t believe and when I tried to contact her to meet up and talk she would ignore my calls or message back saying there was no point speaking and she didn’t want to meet with me. 
After being treated this way I was obviously very hurt and upset and also angry but I’m the kind of guy to just close myself off. Eventually I gave her the the ultimatum which she was clearly looking for and packed up all her stuff and took them to her parents. I told her if I didn’t hear from her in 2 days that the relationship would be over(pretty much was anyway). Of course I hear nothing back so its over. 


A few weeks go by and I try to ask her if she can meet so we can at least talk about everything and end it in a grown up way. When she eventually would answer the phone she would reluctantly agree to meet but then never would. I even went around her house just to ask her once again if we could meet, speak about everything like adults and if the relationship is over for good so be it. She agreed but then once again never set a time to meet. Yet of course she was still going out with her friends so it’s not like she was too busy. I didn’t try contacting her again because I did my bit and was trying to meet but she couldn’t be bothered. 

So it’s been about 5 months since then and I’ve obviously been trying to move on though some days are harder than others. Anyways she contacted me 4 days ago saying hope I’m doing well and asking if we could meet next week as she is off work and needs me to sign some documents, we both shared a car and it’s still in my name so she wants me to sign it over to her so it’s in her name. I don’t care about the car and I’m happy for her to have it I’ve bought myself a new one anyway. 
I’ve got mixed feelings right now I feel mistreated and angry and don’t really want to meet with this kind of attitude. I ignored her message because like I said I don’t know how to approach it. 
Anyway she has messaged me again saying that: hey it’s fine if you don’t want to meet I can just post the documents for you to sign. But at least acknowledge that I have messaged you.

Not really too sure how to go from here and would really appreciate some feedback from an outsiders point of view. Even though it’s been months since I’ve been in contact with her I still have feelings unfortunately and don’t want this to influence how I approach this in a bad way. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
952,"First off, I do have anxiety and PTSD, so I'm definitely a very sensitive and over analyze a lot. 

We've been together 3 months now. He's a nice guy. We've had 2 fights, one as a result of him making a terrible joke about my boob size (he apologized profusely).

He started a new job about a month ago. It has increasingly become busy. We used to text nonstop, now I mostly have to initiate and receive mostly short responses. I feel that the honeymoon phase is fading for him, I notice he makes more comments about my behaviors that annoy him, recently, after we'd just had sex he imitated how my breathing sounded and was like, ""you sounded like you were dying."" I realize I was breathing really heavily, but it's just how I breath when I'm on top.

I don't know what to do. I've definitely told him I don't like jokes about my body and also said I need more communication from him. But I think he is being honest about being busy at work. Do I expect to much here?"
953,"I do fantasize about my boyfriend trust me but I fantasize about female celebrity crushes just as often. I also read erotic fanfiction about them. I've never told my boyfriend because he doesn't like that I'm bisexual, and it makes him uncomfortable if I ever talk about my close female friends (like he doesn't trust me??) That part is a little off topic lol but I don't know whether to feel guilty for still having celebrity crushes. Is this normal or is it like cheating on him in my mind? (I would never be unfaithful in reality of course we've been together for almost a year and we talk about our future constantly)"
954,"Every day I have to sit opposite men on the way to work with their legs open and all I can think about is how much I wanna suck their dicks....

It’s constantly on my mind for some reason. I don’t want them to do anything to me, I just wanna suck them. I’m thinking about bringing it up to my bf, but I don’t know how he will react? 

How would you react if your gf said she really wanted to suck other guys dicks?"
955,"This is going to be a little unstructured, I'm bad with explainations.

 I'll give some context. My (M21) sister (F30) stays up till 3-4am and then sleeps till 8pm everyday she doesn't work. She still lives at home, hasn't gone to school for anything, no relationship for the past 7 years, still works the same grocery store job she has had since she was 18.
(she even has it set up to work 4 hour shifts from 5pm-9pm, so she doesn't have to get up early)
She has no irl friends, and doesn't do anything except go on her pc in her spare time. She never leaves the house unless she needs something, and makes my mom (F57) drive her, even though she has her license, but says she's too afraid to drive. But worstly, she is extremely volatile. She's the kind of person who will start a fight if you look at her wrong.
Not a shot at anybody if you do anything like this, but I doubt you're anything like her.



Honestly this has been a problem for years. Probably since I was about 13. Days off I had from school, weekends, whatever. She sleeps all day, and loses her mind if I wake her up. We've ""agreed"" on 3:30pm(she wanted 5pm) as being a time we're I can call my friends, or make any noise at all. My mom tries to stop her, but she goes absolutely mental and starts screaming at my mom if I wake her up anytime before 3:30. If she doesn't yell at me or my mom, instead, she'll stomp around the house and scoff and tsk about every little inconvenience.

I work nigh full time, and grueling manual labour, so I cherish my days off and like to enjoy my time, but it's almost impossible when she flips over the tv being too loud when it's at like 7 volume, or when I'm laughing with a friend on the phone. I can't remember when, but I actually started watching TV with subtitles because it had to be so quiet, I've done so ever since.

My father (M56) works all day and is the hardest working man I've ever met. So when he gets home he just kinda vegs on the couch, which I understand, he works hard. While he's home, my sister is on her best behavior, won't fight with me or my mom, and won't do anything. But as soon as he's at work, or out of town, it becomes a warzone of her screaming at my mom for how she ruined her life among other lies. She even threatened to say my father (we are half siblings) abused her, which is a complete lie, my father would never do something like that, he spoiled the hell out of her all her life, and loves her dearly, and he actually cried when we told him what she threatened. 


There's a ton more crazy stuff that's happened, I can go into detail if anybody has any questions. I really need some solutions, or ways to deal with this. This house is a prison, and I'm worried about my mom. She has been so aged by getting screamed at for the past 8 years. Please help me.


Td:lr sister is a monster, and is ruining my families life."
956,"Basically, partner and I have been together for 3.5 years and generally very happy. We don't fight, we get along, we travel together when we can and live together. Over the past few months though I've realised partner doesn't belly laugh with me like they do with friends, we don't talk about anything with actual substance when they're home from work (partner works 9-5 Monday to friday and Im a bartender doing shift work). I feel myself craving more affection and attention than what I'm getting, more silliness and stupid jokes. but at the same time nothing in my relationship is inherently bad. I just want more. 

I want to sit down and talk to partner about how I feel but I don't know how to go about it. Any advice? Anyone ever been in a similar boat?"
957,"Hey Reddit, first post and mobile.
Some information, I’m 16 in year 10 and the girl is 18 finishing year 12.

So I was going out with this girl for around 7 and a bit months and we had a genuine connection, we loved the same things, worked together in a bunch of charity fundraisers and just were so happy together that all seemed great.

Couple weeks back we broke up due to a couple people’s reaction to our age difference (I don’t see the big deal but I kinda understand why people would be worried) and because she started to stress about her year 12 exams. The break up wasn’t too bad but she did say that she did want to “hopefully get back together” once she’s done with school.

I’m not sure what to do and if I should try and get back with her down the line or if I should move on. She’s the first girl to take a genuine interest in me and was my first kiss. I’m asking for advice In what to do, any comments are welcome. Just don’t call her a pedo like some people have at school.

Edit: Forgot to mention, the kiss with her was week prior to the break up. That why I’m not sure about her feelings and what to do."
958,"I like this girl and I want to ask her out? We have an established connection, we are friends. How do I ask her out clarifying that I want it to be just the two of us? Give me some example sentences"
959,"I’ve been seeing this man for the last 2 months and he was very honest that he had kids and was on and off with his children mother since January (They we’re together for 10years) Now his meet me his introducing me to his friends and family and they are surprised his with me and are shocked his finally called it officially quits with his ex partner in the short space of time  Of seeing him we’ve built a nice connection but I still do consider myself as a new accessories on his part, he loves to be consider and validated  on the bases of looks his ex was not good looking and he feels like his meet his equal with me. I know this very first world problems however I can’t help but feel like eye candy! Myself I have no kids and I am 6 years younger. Would you think his having a mid life crisis and dragging me along for the ride? Now his pressurising me to introduce him to imy family! (Too Soon!)"
960,"I (18M) recently asked a girl who I knew had a crush on me out(17F) but I don't really feel the same way. It is both of our first relationships. And we have kissed. We have agreed sex is of limits and I know I can trust her on that.(we in high school)  I do like her as a person but not romantically.
Basically my thinking was that I was lonely and it won't hurt to boost my confidence and experience with the opposite sex as I was pretty insecure. Plus she has a crush on me.
I don't want to hurt her in anyway but I want to end in couple months as I am starting to see being single is probably better for a high school guy.
(My first ever reddit post and you people are amazing)
Thoughts?
TL/DR I asked a girl out who I don't love."
961,"For context I work graveyard shift

I (M 27) have noticed a few customers are people I have attempted to flirt with, but tried to be really subtle about it (a policy banning such interactions was among over 100 recently rescinded or changed policies). 

I usually observe before I make a move, and thus far I have seen nothing indicating the presence of a SO in the people in question. Only one problem, I have no idea how to tell whether they are interested or simply being polite. I'll admit that I am not the best at flirting anyways, which probably doesn't help."
962,"I’ve (F19) have been with my boyfriend (M24) officially for 1 month. He said “I love you” about a week ago and it made me a little nervous. He’s had a few serious relationships in the past and I’ve had none, so I asked how soon he’s said it in the previous ones and he said in his most recent one they said it a week in! I definitely feel strongly for him and really really care for him but how do I know its love? And moreover how can he say he loves me when we’ve only been dating a month?"
963,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile.

Fiance (35M) and I (26F) have been together for 3 years. I work mostly mon-fri 10 hour days, so my Saturdays are usually doing house chores, laundry, dishes, yardwork, cook meals, small home repairs etc. 

His schedule for the first 1 1/2 years was nonexistent. He literally had to wait and see if the phone would ring every single morning. So understandably, he was not really able to reliably help with chores.

Now however, he has a new job where he only works a couple of days a week, and is paid on-call  for the whole week. I thought this would mean that I would get to come home to a clean house once in a while. This has not happened; sometimes he will wash dishes. Most of his days off are spent watching YouTube.

I've tried talking to him, and positive reinforcement, to no avail. He always promises to improve, but it only lasts a week at most.I'm at the point now where I'm just not going to do things anymore - I'll wash my laundry, and dishes for instance, but trash, his laundry and dishes, vacuuming and other household tasks will only get done by him, in hopes that he sees how unfair this is. 

Is there a better way I could be handling this?"
964,"My husband Chris and I (Both 26) were together for 2 years before we got married. We did not live together beforehand because we both have strict religious immigrant parents and in our culture it is simply not done. 

When Chris and I were dating he bragged all the time about how well he could cook. He talked about how he took cooking courses as electives in high school because you got to eat the food you cooked and he could meet girls. He talked about how much he loved it and how he was able to cook his own food in college unlike his housemates. He often cooked for me when we were dating to “impress” me and he actually was a great cook. 

This was a huge turn on to me because sexist traditional roles are kinda engrained in our culture and girls are forced to learn to cook while boys aren’t (ex. my sister and I were forced to cook with our mom from when were like 12 while my brother and many male cousins don’t know how to cook at all) Growing up I saw the stress my mom experienced always having to cook for my dad even though she worked full time as a pharmacist only to have him complain about the food half the time. My dad NEVER cooked. My mom felt it was her “duty” and “obligation” as a wife. Although I actually love to cook,  I promised myself I would never end up with a man who refused to cook. A big reason I was initially attracted to Chris was because he was from our culture (good for parents) but could actually cook well. He is a great guy in many other areas but I’m going to be honest, that is what initially attracted me to him. 

However we’ve been married for a bit over a year and he completely stopped cooking. At first it kinda made sense why I did most of the cooking because he worked longer hours than me so I didn’t really complain that much initially but even on Saturdays or Sundays when we both don’t work he just won’t cook. If I ask him to cook he’ll insist on ordering something or warm up left overs or those microwave meals. Most of the time he’ll just say he’s really tired and beg me to cook. Don’t get me wrong I love cooking and he is at least very very complimentary of my cooking and always appreciative but I’m getting a little frustrated because I feel kinda tricked and manipulated. Before we got married he was all about cooking to impress me. Since we got married he’s cooked maybe 3 full meals and each time it was a big deal and treated like a special favour. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about it but whenever I do he makes me feel like I’m nagging. He’ll say he works so much and is tired or that I’m such a “great cook” and make the best food. It feels like I’m practically begging him to cook. I’m just so frustrated about the switch up. He is a great guy in other aspects.  He’s kind and protective and a hard worker but this is become a huge issue for me. This trait also carries onto a lot of other household chores. He often helps wash the dishes after we eat (though I often have to remind him to) but when it comes to sweeping, mopping, dusting, wiping counters, etc  I have to practically force him to help me and he’ll complain about how “we don’t have to sweep everyday.” However, this is not as hurtful as the cooking because I feel most guys aren’t good cleaners and he wasn’t really the most organized or neat when we were dating but the cooking thing just blindsided because he cooked a lot before we got married. I just need advice on how to deal with this. 

**Tl;dr my husband used to cook a lot before we got married. After getting married he has completely stopped and whenever I try talk about it I feel like I’m nagging him**"
965,"So I've been married for 12 years, been with my wife a few years long than that. We have had financial issues and are still recovering from that, its been an on going battle (mainly bills out weigh income) this has lead to some major strife. (especially on my part, I got over whelmed at one and point and kind just shut down. I'm better now though.)

any way current situation, we have not been able to do much of any thing for a long time, no real date nights, no real vacations, etc. She is feeling neglected and I can't say I blame her, I know its not good. So this past week she has been coming home from work and more or less ignoring me. 

She finally talked to me last night, she said she has been getting her thoughts together and was confused. There is a new guy at her job and she says he looks at her the way I used to look at her, and it made her feel the way she did when we first got together. I love my wife, but I didn't get jealous or angry or anything. I almost felt relieved  (I think because I want her to be happy.) 

I'm confused because I don't know how I should feel. I'm not sure if I still love her the way I'm supposed to. I do love her, I am protective and would never want any thing to happen to her, I worry about her if she runs late or goes to the store and is gone longer than normal. We do have one child together (and a cat and  a dog. the cat claimed me, the dog is just a good dog and loves every one.)

I'm not sure what I should do. She says she has not been truly happy for years, and that makes sense because it has been rough, and I'm honestly sure i handled things incorrectly on more than one occasion. I'm just not sure if my feelings are still the same. We laughed about everything last night and the thought of her leaving doesn't break my heart like it should be.. maybe its because I'm almost 40 now, and my mind knows I will survive and be okay?  I just need some advice / words of wisdom. Thanks to any one who can help in any way."
966,"My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years. It’s been amazing, truly. We are each other’s “one” for sure. Since quitting his long term (11 years) salary job in July due to being downright miserable, he was unemployed for about 7 weeks which depleted our savings since my income alone can’t fully support us, and tried to do insurance sales and we even invested money for him to pursue it, but it didn’t work out. He’s now starting waiting tables until he finds a new salary job again to help bring money in and take some weight off of me, but I feel so fucking overwhelmed and stuck.

I hate my job. I hate it. I’ve been here 3 years now and it’s just such a bad company that doesn’t care about its employees. However, I’ve just felt stuck here because I’m the sole earner, we need to keep our bills paid. I’m also overwhelmed because back in 2018 we both realized since we weren’t getting ahead and we had debts to pay, we’d downgrade entirely and move in with family for a bit. We paid off his debts (~$14k, old loans, a collection, etc.) and started working on mine (about ~4K in credit cards but that’s all) but barely made a dent in it before we lost his stable income when he quit. So I feel stuck because I need this income, I need the benefits, and my boyfriend only brings home a couple hundred or so a week. Hopefully he’ll start getting more shifts but regardless, I want him in a salary job again. I feel so much pressure. We took care of all his debts and his car and he’s been able to try new jobs and figure it all out and I’ve just been stuck at this crappy job managing our finances and keeping us above water. 

I want to pay down my debt, I want to go back to school in the spring to focus on my chosen career path. I need enough money after bills to take care of my mental health. I can’t do any of that if he’s just waiting tables. I feel stuck. I can’t even find a new job, although I’ll keep trying, because no matter how long I scout job sites I’ll apply and apply but there aren’t many jobs in my local area (rural) that would pay me similarly and I can’t afford a pay cut. I’m so sick of long ass commutes. (Currently commute 45mins to an hour or so, depending the day, to my current job)

I love him and I hate making it sound like he’s a bad boyfriend because he’s so emotionally uplifting and loving, supportive, funny, and truly a wonderful partner, just the stress of jobs and finances are burning me out entirely and I feel like there’s an imbalance that is just too heavy for me to handle. If I made enough alone to support us comfortably I’d be better about this and be fine with him taking his time finding a new career but that isn’t the case and it’s eating at me. I feel like I’m putting so many of my own personal goals on hold for him and I can’t pour from an empty cup. I keep telling myself this is all temporary but the “end” of this temporary shit feels farther and farther away each day.

I don’t want to break up, we’ve started a life together, but idk wtf to do. I guess talk to him, I mean he already knows I’ve been stressed and unhappy and wants to do what he can to make me happy but honestly I don’t need emotional fulfillment right now, it would just make me happy if he had a stable income again. And I don’t want to be a bitch and be too pushy or nag or like I’m forcing him into another job he doesn’t like. I just need help."
967,"I have been dating this amazing individual for close to 4 years now. We had one break that lasted about 5 months for reasons relating to this topic. Now, when we 1st started dating we both smoked pot together but I needed to stop for work related reasons. I had smoked pot recreationally with friends throughout high school, Last time I smoked pot it boosted my anxiety and caused me to be paranoid, its just not for me. I have lots to loose with this career path I have taken. I am 25 and she is 26, She had been in a car accident about 7 years ago and luckily chose to smoke pot as an alternative to prescription medication. In my opinion this is something that can be abused over time, At one point when we 1st started dating it was a wake n' Bake thing, Lunch, Dinner.. All the time. Since then she picked up more working hours and does not have the oporotunity to smoke that often. I work from 5am till sometimes 5pm Monday through Thursday and sometimes Fridays. When I get home, most every time its within 30 min that she says ""I'm going outback to smoke"". I don't consider myself ""Controlling"" by any means, I'm just uncomfortable with how Freequently she has been smoke recently &amp; it has become an issue with how we deal with this topic. We have had discussions about her smoking pot so frequently &amp; about how it annoys me that I dont spend much sober time with her. This is a girl that I do want to marry and have a future with , I feel that we need to be able to get past this what I call ""Speed Bump"" before we take this relationship to the next level. We plan on talking about this this coming weekend to express feelings and find out what we both have in mind anf how we can move forward with this stupid argument that has become more than just "" A little Argument"". Please help out with any recommendations of topics to bring up in our next face to face meaningfull conversation. Thanks"
968,"I've (22f) been with my boyfriend(25m) for 3 years now and I love him deeply but we have been having some issues. Despite these issues we have been trying to make it work even though I am left feeling hurt by our communication issues. I'm not too worried about it because we're making a lot of progress and both are making efforts to work on things. He's really the man I want to be with at the end of the day. But because of all this, I decided to start working (Im a college student) to spend some of my free time and meet some people to get my mind off my relationship. Well now I'm in this situation where I have found myself crushing and being a little silly, semi-flirtatious with someone I work with. When I first met him I thought he was kind of cute but did not think anything of it at all. Him and I both have silly personalities so we joke around a lot. At first I seriously only considered it as just joking around. Even though I thought he was cute, I never thought about pursuing him! I still don't. But he is starting to get flirtatious with me and take the joking around too far by bumping into me on purpose, winking at me, and just being kind of weird. At first I ignored it and kept treating him the same, but the last time we worked together I found myself starting to like it almost. I've never said anything suggestive back to him, but I didn't necessarily tell him to stop flirting with me. I did ask him why he was being weird and reminded him I have a boyfriend but even when I said that I feel like I was being too playful in my tone of voice. He responded by saying he was ""just messing around"". So now I just feel guilty because I started to enjoy this guys' attention and flirting. I even found myself hoping his shift wouldn't end before mine and even asked him when he was leaving just cause I found myself wanting to be around him cause I enjoy his company. That question was probably the farthest I ever took it. It got taken too far in my mind and immediately after my shift I was like ""wtf"" in my head because I was thinking about him so much during work. I felt incredibly guilty and ended up telling my boyfriend that this guy has been flirting with me and I had not done anything to stop it. I just feel bad because I didn't tell him that I have a small crush on the dude. He would be so upset :( We both agreed that I have an issue with not being able to say no and that next time I work him I should ignore him completely. I am totally ok with that. I don't want anything to do with the guy at work, but I feel so guilty because of my little fantasies in my head. Have I done something wrong? I love my boyfriend a lot but I'm worried I took it too far by letting my mind wander and letting him flirt with me! I seriously feel like a cheater even though I haven't actually done anything if that makes sense."
969,"So me and this girl in my class (both 16) were really flirty for a while, and i really thought it would go somewhere. I was really straight forward with my love for her and for me it felt like she liker me back. This has been going on since school started. Fast forward until 2 days and she is in a relationship with a 18 year old guy and doesnt tell me about it and lets me flirt with her while she is a relationship..
I just found out about this when i checked Facebook like an hour ago... what should i do?"
970,"This has probably been asked a lot but maybe I'm just confused. Well me and my boyfriend met last year and I only wanted to be friends. He asked me out so many times till I gave in. About 6 months later I dumped him because he was really clingy, kinda creepy, and just doesn't quite get me.

Well about 5 months ago I was about to get kicked out of my parents house and he told me I could live with him. He told me how he'd help me with my body dysphoria and even let me work at home or not even work at all. I was excited but knowing how we didn't workout I told him only as roomates and since my friend was in the same situation I asked if she could move in even though they didn't get along and he said it was fine. Well I ran away from home and moved into his tiny apartment. We had already decided months before we'd move into this three bedroom apartment yet we didn't know where everyone would be moving into.

At this time I don't really know what happened. I guess I forgot what happened in our past relationship and I guess I thought of him as the nicest guy for helping me so we started sleeping in the same bed. Around this same time he told me that he never told his parents about us breaking up because he was scared how much they'd make fun of him or something like that. I was annoyed to say the least but I agreed to let his parents think we were dating. I mean it wasn't much compared to him helping me out, right?

Well we moved into the new house and it's really beautiful but for awhile I was mad at myself for not caring. The house was beautiful, my life was getting started, and maybe even perfect so why was I angry? I just didn't care.. at the same time me and my friend started fighting and sadly enough I ended it. She had stolen something important to me so I decided to just end it.

When I ended the friendship almost immediately after I went into this depressed mode. We went to a plastic surgery place and they told us the whole thing was going to cost around $13,000 with a monthly payment of $300. He told me it was way too much and is now telling me to get a job. He also wants me to get a job for furniture. At this moment we're sleeping on two twin beds on the floor. He told me as soon as I get a job we could get a nicer bed but what he also didn't tell me was that I was going to pay for it. Even his parents think that's bullshit.

Well now I get why I wasn't happy here. I ignored all my fears and now they've become a reality. My body dysphoria has only gotten worse, since I've left my friend I have no one talk to about stupid things with (because conversations like ours were way above him), and now I have to buy every piece of furniture and on top of that he's a pig. When I was out of a job he made sure to make the house a mess every single day so I'd have to clean it. Now he can't break out of that habbit so I have to work and then clean. Listen I know I'm not the brightest bulb in the package but I don't want to come home hearing about how stupid I am. He doesn't understand that I have depression and he thinks of me as lazy. He doesn't understand I have anxiety/panic attacks and he thinks I'm always being over dramatic. 

(A little NSFW)
I have a high sex drive and sex has become something I want to avoid altogether. He only lasts for 15 minutes at most (he goes for three rounds and that's about 2 minute breaks) and he doesn't even try to help me release. He only does it for himself. I'm usually not even horny when he wants it. He just gets on top of me and starts humping me until I either give in or I push him off. He also makes fun of me when I accidentally fart like I'm sorry I can't control myself all the time. I thought to myself the only way I can maybe salvage this relationship was either an open relationship or a poly relationship. He told me no and only wanted a monogamous relationship. I respect his decision and I won't pressure him into one but at the same time I'm just so unhappy. 

It hasn't been that long since we started dating and yet I'm so unhappy. I don't really know what to do. A part of me just thinks I'm only looking at the negative and since I'm so mad I can't think of the positive. Just every little thing bothers me now. Yesterday we got some flu shots and this morning I set out some DayQuil so he didn't feel so sick. Well he took a sip and just left saying how it was disgusting and it most likely wouldn't help anyways. I don't know why it makes me so mad.. it feels like he just doesn't trust me. Like I'm some idiot he saved and now with his perfect guidance I'm going to better.. well better for him.

Lately I've been thinking about how he doesn't see the real me and just thinks of me as someone else entirely. Maybe I am just a little crazy but I don't know if I can talk to him about it. He doesnt listen to me and if he does listen and he doesn't understand he'll just go along with it. He won't argue with me and he'll just shrug it off. I have a temper so I like to argue to fix things but he doesn't argue and I'm trying not let that bother me and it just does so much..

I really don't know what to do. I can't move in with my parents, I refuse to talk to my old friend, my only other option is to just move out yet he wants to start taking half my paycheck for furniture, fun activities, and because he took care of me all these months. Should I stay with him while paying off my plastic surgery? I just don't know

Maybe I'm just being too emotional or maybe I really am not happy. I can't tell and I just have no idea what to do..

Edit: also I'm worried if I break up with him that he'd kill himself. He doesn't talk sucide or depression usually but I just have a fear.. he has a sister that has a piece of shit boyfriend and I'm thinking about having her move in with us? She's pregnant and her boyfriend only wants to live with his parents. He doesn't treat her like a pregnant woman and makes her clean the house. His parents adopt special needs kids as well and makes her take care of them and then she goes to work. The guy refuses to get a job and just wants to be lazy.. I feel awful and I want to help but maybe I'm just doing it for the wrong reason.."
971,"I have always wanted to date hot girls my age ever since high school started. However, I had no success with any of them because of how ugly I was and that fact that they somehow found out I did nerdy stuff such as watching anime and playing video games.  And as someone who wouldn't want to settle for less and follow the condescending advice of 'lower your standards', I didn't just sit around and do nothing. I did everything I could think of to be more appealing to such hot girls, even to this day, such as working out, skin care, haircut, weight lifting, shaving, and better hiding my nerdy interests in front of them. After such attempts of improvement, I retried approaching hot girls with attempts of small talk, only to remain completely ignored. Is there any way I can finally grab the attention of hot girls in my college, and succeed in dating them?"
972,"So this is asking for both personal advice and relationship advice 

I was always really sheltered and introverted my whole life, my parents were really strict so I never got to do anything fun. I was fine but I was always curious. Honestly I don’t regret it because I got good grades and spent a lot of time with my family. But I was finally allowed to move out. I got an apartment with my sister and she’s cool and not strict or anything. We eat out all the time and just watch movies. She went home for a weekend because she had a short week and I stayed at my apartment so I was all alone. So I kind of had my own “rumspringa” lol I got dressed up  and looked good and I went to one of the bars with a few friends from my college. My first time going to a bar lol. I didn’t drink but it was exciting doing something “bad”. So many hot guys were talking to me!! I felt so good about myself. I met a really cute guy there (and he’s in med school!!) and I felt so shy and nervous inside but I was just talking a lot and being confident and when I told him that I’m usually painstakingly shy, he was shocked lol. I was never even kissed before, obviously I’m a virgin. I liked him so much. I know it was infatuation since I barely even knew him, we were just talking about tv and funny things. But I had so much fun. He kept calling me beautiful and crazy because I was being so loud and I let him kiss me. It was amazing!!! We didn’t do anything but this is kind of tmi lol but i let him under my skirt — it was so good!!!! He knew what he was doing. I’m blushing just thinking about it. He asked me to go to his place but I said no. I keep thinking that I wish I just went but I’m also kind of glad that I didn’t because I feel like I’d regret just sleeping with some random guy. I don’t even know his last name. 

Anyway I went home, rumspringa was over, my sister came back. I just went back to normal and it’s so crazy, no one knows that I went to a bar and met a guy lol. 

Well that was like last weekend and this guy keeps texting me!! He wants to see me again and take me out for drinks. I guess he didn’t realize that I wasn’t drinking. I don’t know if I should say yes or no. The thing is, I was someone else that he saw. I’m not loud and crazy and fun and hot like that. I’m pretty quiet most of the time and I don’t wear tiny skirts, I borrowed my outfit from my friend. I don’t even drink. I’m just nerdy and I usually study or watch tv. I feel like he’s expecting that girl and that was just a one night thing. Like he wouldn’t like the real me. I never even told him that I’m a virgin and never had a boyfriend or anything. And I’d feel so stupid if he was just looking to hook up because I’m not gonna do that. Is there any way to ask him “are you only interested in sex” without sounding rude? And I know it’s stupid, I met him at a bar, obviously he was just looking for a girl to hook up with, not a girlfriend. But I guess I have high hopes that he’s interested in me for real. 

So some advice? Should I just tell him that I can’t see him again?"
973,"THIS IS A UPDATE POST 

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d872zr/19m_how_to_rekindle_childhood_friendship_with_19f/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

So I asked her if she was available last weekend to catch up and get coffee and she said yes but she had to check her schedule for one conflict and she would get back to me.

She ended up not getting back to me

I'm really at a loss at what to do at this point, I mean we were good friends when we were Young and we have a almost year long streak score on Snapchat ( not that it means much). Part of me wants to follow up with her and try again but I'm afraid of being rejected again?

Tldr: tried hanging out with childhood friend who goes to same college campus as me last week but she blew me off?"
974,"We dated for a year and 8 months, but he was living in a different state for a year. He came back 3 months ago, and we were supposed to move in together, but excuses were made. We stopped being intimate and were getting really bored of eachother. He broke up with me a week ago, and I think we were both caught really off guard at first, but looking back it has been a long time coming. 

He wants to be friends, but I am the first person he's ever dated for longer than a month and I'm not sure he knows best. I have always been the type to be friends with exes, but this is by far the longest relationship I've been in. 

The thing is, the romantic aspect of our relationship was essentially gone aside from the occasional peck on the cheek. I had also been imagining our future together fairly often (although I'm not sure why, like I said, it was a long time coming). I don't think I could handle seeing him date someone else right now, but I really don't think he will for a while. 

But I really miss talking to him and hanging out with him. He was my best friend. Also, we never fought. 

Tl:Dr; ex and i got along great. Want to be friends. Don't know what to do.

What do you think, reddit? Is it ok to be friends?"
975,"We've been together for almost a decade now, but it seems like the last few years have been going downhill for us. We have frequent fights over what most people would consider trivial like whoever does more chores, where our money goes, etc. It usually leads to yelling, me crying, and after a day, we act like nothing happened and move on. Sometimes we do try to talk it out, but I've noticed that in almost every argument we've had, he's always the right one and I always have to apologize or try to win him back or have to do better.

Recently, we've been fighting a lot more, and whenever we do, I'm left alone to cry and wish for something better than this kind of relationship. On top of my depression and other mental health issues, you can imagine why I'm unhappy. I would never dare to cheat on him, but I don't really think I'm willing to leave him either. We've been through so much and for so long, that it almost seems impossible to split up now. He's also the only one I have left, aside from a few friends who live in different cities, so that makes it a bit more difficult as well.

Anyone have any advice for me?"
976,"I met this guy through Tinder about 10 months ago. We started dating 'officially' in April this year, and I have been head over heels in love with him since May/June. He is sweet, funny, and caring to everyone he knows. I honestly couldn't think of a better person for me.

&amp;#x200B;

He started talking about future plans with me this summer for buying a house together, marriage, and kids. He kept telling me how much his family loved me and how his older sister jokingly said that she ""knew a engagement ring jeweler if he ever wanted his number"". He mentioned having children in the next 3-ish years and proposing to me a few months after we moved in together. I wasn't prepared for these conversations at first because I thought we were rushing into things, but the more we spoke about it, the more excited I grew. Plus, to me, it feels like he is almost ready for this kind of stuff. He's a lot older/mature relative to me, has a excellent career and is one of the only guys I've met that says ""Aww look at that baby"" when we are in public together.

I feel like I may have started to make our future the main point of conversation every time we hung out together, and I think there may have been a point (in August) where he started to realize we were moving too fast... because he had started to get silent/unresponsive every time I brought the future up. He also had started to use ""maybe/if"" a lot in our conversations if he ever brought things up himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him why he suddenly stopped talking about the future with me and he said he ""didn't want to us to make a ton of expectations for one another just in case the relationship didn't last - he would be disappointed"". I got the hint, and I have cut back a lot on our conversations about the future. But, I still find I talk about wedding topics quite a bit if I'm ever drunk around him on the weekend.

I have began to obsess about the future on my own with him. He moved out of his parents place about an hour away in September and I miss him like crazy during the week.

I've been in two previous relationships, one in high school and one lasting 5 years (we broke up in October 2018). In both of those relationships, I was fine and concentrating on my career/studies. It's gotten me very far and I'm doing extremely well for myself, but this new obsession is starting to hinder me. I haven't been really studying for my professional exams that advance me further into my career (I've been outside of university for 2.5 years), as when I'm alone I am constantly looking at pinterest/reddit wedding or baby related things. I have stopped working out and I have gained 20 lbs. All I can think about is a future with my boyfriend and part of me feels absolutely crazy for thinking about it this much. Before this relationship I would constantly say I wouldn't dream of getting married until at least 5 years from now. I'm only 23 years old and have only been dating this guy for less than a year but I can't help to feel jealous when I see old friends or family getting engaged or having children.

I have never felt this way before and I'm not sure what to do/how to handle things. I feel like if I bring up the future any more with him, he will get turned off and it will ruin our relationship. Please help me, as part of me still knows I shouldn't be feeling like this at my age/this early into a relationship.

He also asked me to move in with him next month, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea given the state I'm in?

Thanks for the help."
977,"Girlfriend indirectly said dick is small, but I'm not and kinda feel emasculated. How do I respond?"
978,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but there's a lot of complicated history here.

A year ago, we met through a common interest. After 6 months, we started to have feelings for each other. She was semi-broken up with her boyfriend when we started the romance, but she ended up keeping him and me and it became a weird kinda-poly thing. It wasn't the situation I would have wanted, but I was in love and was willing to give it a try. She has some medical and mental issues and he was her security blanket.

Things were good at first, but she's naturally distant and avoidant, whereas I have discovered I am anxious and thrive on constant communication. This, combined with the structure of the relationship, took a mental toll on my and my anxieties grew worse and worse. In many situations that we'd attend, I had to just be the ""friend"" because many didn't know about the situation, and this also drove my anxieties. Also, I didn't see her nearly as much as I'd have liked. Texting or communicating to her felt like a struggle. As I got worse, I became more and more jealous and possessive. I did not like myself very much for becoming that. I tried to talk to her about us and the relationship, but she always pulled away at intense conversations, and I was feeling desperate and not wanting to lose the little bit of connection we had, so I never pressed it.

On top of these, she is naturally more gregarious than I am. She thrives in social situations and is naturally flirtatious. This was also a driver of my anxieties.

Eventually, I reached a breaking point and ended things a few months ago when I just couldn't take the mental strain any more. I still loved her (that had never changed) but I couldn't live under the paradigm.

After the initial sadness passed, I actually felt good, because now that my brain was no longer preoccupied with the Relationship, I felt like I could actually be a better friend for her and give her advice I was afraid of giving when I was still terrified of losing the little relationship we had before. I even suggested to her that she claim the independence that she'd always told me she wanted. Shortly after that, she broke up with her other boyfriend, which was honestly surprising. I immediately could see a newfound independence and strength in her and that made me genuinely happy for her.

A couple weeks passed, and in between, I started talking with another woman I met online. We had a lot of things in common, but it was purely online as she lived several states away. When she found out, she got angry, and felt hurt that I'd ""moved on"" so quickly. Some very angry outbursts from her followed.

A couple weeks after that, she wanted to get back together with me. She promised me everything I'd always wanted from the start. She said she wanted the relationship she always wanted to give me. Committed and exclusive.

She explained how she realized that she had become worse and worse because of the other boyfriend's own depressions and issues and enabling behavior. She said she'd always wanted it from the start but couldn't bring herself to leave him at the time because of his ""security blanket"" status and making the ""poly"" situation was the only way she saw to have me at the time. She apologized for all her behaviors.

I'd told myself I wouldn't consider ever going back to the relationship we'd had before, but now things were demonstrably different because it would just be the two of us. I said Yes and we have been at this for about 6 weeks.

She has kept up all of her promises. We've spent every night together since (we live very very close to each other, so this is easy). We gone on a couple short trips that have been wonderful.

However, the anxieties I had before have not gone away, even though there have been no real reasons to have them in the new version of the relationship. Here are the issues I'm having.

\*In relationship 1.0 she expressed that she never wanted to get married, never wanted to actually meet my family, that spending every day together wasn't healthy and a lot of other similar ideas. Now in relationship 2.0, she says she wants all those things and that the previous sentiments were her way of keeping me at arms length because of the weird structure of the relationship 1.0. This full reversal of so many core concepts makes it hard for me to trust.

\*My anxieties, in general, lead to a lot of Imposter Syndrome at work and with friends, and the strength of the feelings I have for her magnify those anxieties to the same levels where the relationship is concerned. I fear she'll grow bored of me, or that anyone she meets will simply be seen as better than me in every way.

\*I'm very jealous. Simply noticing her friending someone on facebook activates my anxieties. Even her going to do something with a male friend of hers (whom I know is not a romantic interest), puts me into a panic.

\*Whenever she is typing on her phone, texting anyone, it is a physical struggle for me to not try to look and see who she's talking to.

\*I just generally am having a hard time trusting her completely because of the behaviors I learned under relationship 1.0

\*Our communication styles are polar opposites. I always respond to a text as quickly as I can. waiting for her to respond to mine can feel interminable. She has been far better now than she was before, but we are still very different here.

\*I want to be with her virtually all the time. I don't have a good sense of my own self as a person even before the relationship started, so within the relationship, she is the best source of happiness I have.

\*We've talked about getting a place together. Normally I am the first one to suggest these things, but because of my other hangups this time, talks of more committed things like that are giving me a lot of trepidation.

I have talked to her about my anxieties and concerns from the outset of relationship 2.0. She's been good about listening, but I'm fearing that its becoming too much for her. Then again, I know that may just be my anxiety convincing me that its becoming too much for her and not it actually becoming too much for her.

Basically, my anxiety is making me exhibit all the classic signs of general relationship anxiety (except for anger. I'm not an angry person and would never do anything to hurt her in any way). I know that they are emotions that lead to toxic behaviors, except that I will drive myself into anxious knots and panics rather than actually act on any of them in a negative way toward her. Rationally, she has been amazing in Relationship 2.0, and yet I'm acting with all the fears and feelings I built up toward the end of relationship 1.0.

I want to be a better, stronger, more confident partner for her, but I am really terrified that I can't be and that she'll get fed up and end it eventually anyways. So my own anxieties and imposter syndrome are working extra hard to convince me to end things now before the certainly must end worse later. So much of me is screaming to end it because I feel like she'd be better off without me.

Basically, I'm having a hard time seeing through the haze of my anxieties to have a clear picture of what I should be doing.

I know this is already long, but I hope I've given a clear enough picture for anyone to help me out with any advice."
979,"I have been with my girlfriend for about 1 year and a half. We knew each other for about 7 years before actually starting to try. It has been great throughout those time. We’re both almost from the same city, and I moved to College and she followed 2 years later. We do live with each other now and it has been great like I said until one month ago.

We’ve been constantly arguing, and it has led me to depression. I have felt empty inside and just unhappy in general. I guess that’s where you can say you don’t know if you love someone until you actually move in with them. Anyways, she would criticize me for being in a bad mentally state, asking “I hate when you’re like this. Selfish”. So I hate coming home, knowing there’s a possibility that she will snap once again and put me down when I am already at my low. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t handle it and honestly, fell out of any feelings I had for her. During this one month of arguing, I have my co worker who is funny, amazing person. She is sweet and was there for me throughout it all and honestly, she’s the only person that I’m with that I can be out of that state of sadness. 

Last night, I didn’t want to go home at all. I wanted to be away from those who were really close to me. That’s when my co worker decided to offer me a place to stay for the night. She understands my feelings and my place with my GF, but I do think she might like me and I think I grew more into her while I started to fall out with my current GF. We talked a lot and I enjoyed her company. During that night, my GF texted me at 3 am, saying how she wants me home, that she is threatening to do things and how she feels unloved. I feel bad, but I felt my feelings have already flew out the door. So I no longer want to be with her.

So my question is this. How should I break up with her or how do I, knowing or feeling scared that she will do something to herself. Keep in mind, our actual hometown is 4 hours away, PLUS, she really doesn’t have anyone up here but me. Sad to say, but I don’t love her anymore, but I’m all she’s got."
980,"My and my girlfriend have been together for just over two years. We normally get along really well. She calls me everytime she get in her car. If she gets out of class she calls, or gets out of work she calls. She gets upset if I don't call her when I get out of work. 

We've argued before about it, she gets frustrated because I'm not always talkative on the phone. Ive expressed how much I dislike phone calls, but she takes it as me not wanting to talk to her at all. We recently moved in together and we talk at home all the time. We also recently started arguing more, but generally only when were on the phone, not when we're together. 

The last time I tried to bring it up she assumed I don't like talking to her at all. How can I approach her and keep things calm?"
